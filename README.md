# Database elaborated after a systematic review
Here we compile data from more than 150 papers of intrinsic rate of increase variation along temperature gradients
Then, we analyze data to examine heterogeneity across taxa and feeding guilds. We also model the response with a nonlinear approach to compute a summary effect.
