# Database IntRaPests
Here we compile data from more a final set of 56 studies of *intrinsic rate of increase* (*r*<sub>m</sub>) variation along temperature gradients in laboratory controlled conditions.

We fit **nonlinear physiological models** to estimate variability of **thermal traits** (i.e. T<sub>min</sub>, T<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>opt</sub>) across groups such as taxa and feeding guilds, and across latitudines, thereby aiming to infer possible future trends in a climate change context.

Note that _Aglais io_'s caterpillars seldom feed on crops but on nettles (we only display image here for its imagal beauty)
