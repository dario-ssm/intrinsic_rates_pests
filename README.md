# Database IntRaPests
Here we compile data from more a final set of 56 studies of intrinsic rate of increase variation along temperature gradients in laboratory controlled conditions.
We aim to fit nonlinear physiological models to estimate variability of thermal traits (i.e. Tmin, Tmax and Topt) for different groups (i.e. taxa, feeding guilds, etc), for latitudinal trends to infer possible future trends in a climate change context.
