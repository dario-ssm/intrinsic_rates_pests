Age-specific life tables were used to estimate the effects of temperature on its demographic parameters. Diapause in SATP had not been characterized prior to our study. We found facultative diapause in pupae developing from larvae exposed to relatively low temperatures (i.e., 2 and 5 degrees C) and short-day length for different exposure periods. The strength of diapause was measured as an increase in post-treatment developmental times of pupae (i.e., degree days) that on average were 2.45-3-fold greater than of pupae reared at favorable temperatures.

J,1,"Islam, T; Roknuzzaman, AHM; Hassan, K; Ullah, MS","The eggplant shoot and fruit borer (ESFB), Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a notorious insect pest that causes havoc across all eggplant cultivation areas in Bangladesh. Remarkably, its relationship with environmental factors such as temperature is not clearly defined. We measured the effects of a range of temperatures (22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 degrees C) on the population growth parameters of ESFB under laboratory conditions (60 +/- 5% relative humidity and 16 L:8 D photoperiod), developing an age-stage, two-sex life table. Results indicate that temperature significantly reduced development times and adult total lifespan and affected ESFB life table parameters (P < 0.05). Specifically, the egg hatching time reduced from 5 days at 22 degrees C to 3 days at 30 degrees C, while larval and pupal duration reduced from 12 to 8 days and 10 to 7 days respectively.

J,0,"Govindan, BN; Hutchison, WD","Temperature is a critical single factor influencing insect population dynamics, and is foundational for improving our understanding of the phenology of invasive species adapting to new agroecosystems or in the process of range expansion. An age-stage, two-sex life table was therefore developed to analyze fundamental demographic features such as development, survival, and reproduction of a Minnesota-acclimated population of the invasive brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys), in the north central USA. All salient life history parameters were estimated to better understand the population growth potential of H. halys at the current limit of its northern range in North America. We examined the effect of selected constant temperatures on immature development and survival (15-39 degrees C), adult reproduction and longevity (17-36 degrees C) of H. halys in the laboratory. The Minnesota population developed faster and survived at higher rates relative to a population that had previously established in Pennsylvania, USA. Mean generation time for the Minnesota population was minimized at 30 degrees C, while survival and fecundity were maximized at 27 and 23 degrees C, respectively. Given these findings, we assessed the effect of temperature on the intrinsic rate of increase (rm), the life table parameter that integrates the effects of temperature on development, survival, and reproduction. A Ratkowsky model predicted rm was maximized (0.0899) at 27.5 degrees C.

Elevated CO2 decreased N content and increased total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) content and the TNC: N ratio in maize leaves.

The nonlinear Lactin model described accurately the effect of temperature on the intrinsic rate of natural increase of M. unicostata populations and predicted the optimum temperature for population increase at 34.1 degrees C, at which the population doubling time is 3.6 days. Produced values of lower and upper thresholds for M. unicostata populations were 14.8 and 38.8 degrees C, respectively.

J,1,"Guo, TT; Li, LL; Men, XY; Lu, ZB; Chen, H; Wang, ZY; Sun, TL; Yu, Y","Athetis dissimilis (Hampson) has emerged as a serious pest on corn in recent years in China. Understanding the population response of A. dissimilis to temperature will be beneficial for adopting control strategies for this pest. The impact of five constant temperatures (17, 21, 25, 29, and 33 degrees C) on the life table of A. dissimilis was studied using age-stage, two-sex life table method in the laboratory. The results showed that the developmental time of egg, larva, pupa, and adult decreased when temperature increased from 17 degrees C to 33 degrees C. The TPOP (total preoviposition period) decreased with temperature increasing from 17 degrees C to 29 degrees C, while the longest APOP (adult preoviposition period) occurred at 21 degrees C (3.57d) and the shortest at 33 degrees C (2.15d). The fecundity increased from 407.52 to 763.94 eggs as temperatures were raised from 17 to 25 degrees C, but decreased at temperatures from 25 degrees C to 33 degrees C.The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), and net reproductive rate (R-0) increased as temperatures increased from 17 to 25 degrees C, then decreased when temperatures exceeded 25 degrees C. In contrast, the mean generation time (T) decreased as temperatures increased from 17 to 33 degrees C. Based on the estimated data, the highest female age-stage-specific fecundity (f(x)) and age-specific fecundity (m(x)) were 81.91 and 45.04 eggs, respectively, at 25 degrees C.

J,1,"Jiang, HX; Zhang, XC; Niu, SH; Feng, JN","Anaphothrips obscurus is a cosmopolitan pest feeding on cereals and other grasses. The effects of constant temperatures on the biology of A. obscurus are not well known. Laboratory studies were conducted to assess the effects of temperature on the development, survival, longevity, fecundity and population parameter of A. obscurus at six constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 32, 35 degrees C). The hatchability was the lowest at 15 degrees C, the highest at 25 degrees C and no eggs hatched at 35 degrees C. Developmental rates increased linearly as the temperature increased. The lower developmental threshold temperature was 10.6 degrees C and 200 degree-days were required to complete development from egg to adult. Adult longevity decreased with increasing temperature, and ranged from 68.87 d at 15 degrees C to 16.41 d at 32 degrees C. The highest total fecundity occurred at 20 degrees C with 162 eggs per female. The temperature-dependent total fecundity, age-specific oviposition rate, and age-specific survival rate models were described. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was significantly higher at 30 and 32 degrees C (0.239 and 0.250) than at other temperatures. This study suggests that optimal developmental and reproductive temperatures for A. obscurus ranges between 25 and 30 degrees C and this may help this species adapt to warmer areas and widen its distribution and potential for damage in response to global warming.

J,1,"Chen, WH; Li, CY; Chang, TY","The litchi spider mite Oligonychus litchii Lo & Ho is one of the major pests of fruit crops in Taiwan. This study investigated the life history of the litchi spider mite on wax apple (Syzygium samarangense Merr. & Perry) at five constant temperatures (16, 20, 25, 30, and 32 degrees C) under 70 +/- 5% RH and a 12L:12D photoperiod. Ninety-five percent of the eggs hatched at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, respectively. The entire developmental period was 40.3 days at 16 degrees C and only 93 days at 32 degrees C. The low developmental threshold temperature for development from egg to adult was 10.1 degrees C, and the effective accumulated temperature was 197.5 degree-days (DD). Unmated female mites had the longest life span although the oviposition period shortened as temperature increased. Mated female mites produced significantly more eggs than unmated females. At most, a mated female could produce an average of 3.5 eggs per day at 25 degrees C and a maximum of 60.3 eggs over, he entire oviposition period at 20 degrees C. Unmated females exclusively produce male offspring, indicating that litchi spider mites are arrhenotokous. At 25 degrees C, the intrinsic rate of increase (r) was 0.1610 day(-1), the net reproductive rate (R-0) was 19.58 offspring, the finite rate of increase (lambda) was 1.1747 day(-1), and the mean generation time (T) was 18.50 days.

J,1,"Chen, HS; Yang, L; Huang, LF; Wang, WL; Hu, Y; Jiang, JJ; Zhou, ZS","Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), a worldwide distributive invasive pest, originated from the United States, and it was first reported in Guangdong province, China, in 2008. The effects of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the life history traits of P. solenopsis on Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. (Malvales: Malvaceae) were studied at seven constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5, and 35 degrees C) and three RHs (45, 60, and 75%). The results showed that temperature, RH, and their interactions significantly influenced the life history traits of P. solenopsis. First instar was the most sensitive stage to extreme temperatures with very low survival rates at 15 and 35 degrees C. At 25-32.5 degrees C and the three RHs, the developmental periods of entire immature stage were shorter with values between 12.5-18.6 d. The minimum threshold temperature and the effective accumulative temperature for the pest to complete one generation were 13.2 degrees C and 393.7 degree-days, respectively. The percentage and longevity of female adults significantly differed among different treatments. It failed to complete development at 15 or 35 degrees C and the three RHs. Female fecundity reached the maximum value at 27.5 degrees C and 45% RH. The intrinsic rate for increase (r), the net reproductive rate (R-0), and the finite rate of increase (lambda) reached the maximum values at 27.5 degrees C and 45% RH (0.22 d(-1), 244.6 hatched eggs, and 1.25 d(-1), respectively).

J,1,"Khadioli, N; Tonnang, ZEH; Muchugu, E; Ong'amo, G; Achia, T; Kipchirchir, I; Kroschel, J; Le Ru, B","Maize (Zea mays) is a major staple food in Africa. However, maize production is severely reduced by damage caused by feeding lepidopteran pests. In East and Southern Africa, Chilo partellus is one of the most damaging cereal stem borers mainly found in the warmer lowland areas. In this study, it was hypothesized that the future distribution and abundance of C. partellus may be affected greatly by the current global warming. The temperature-dependent population growth potential of C. partellus was studied on artificial diet under laboratory conditions at six constant temperatures (15, 18, 20, 25, 28, 30, 32 and 35 degrees C), relative humidity of 75 +/- 5% and a photoperiod of L12:L12 h. Several non-linear models were fitted to the data to model development time, mortality and reproduction of the insect species. Cohort updating algorithm and rate summation approach were stochastically used for simulating age and stage structure populations and generate life-table parameters. For spatial analysis of the pest risk, three generic risk indices (index of establishment, generation number and activity index) were visualized in the geographical information system component of the advanced Insect Life Cycle modeling (ILCYM) software. To predict the future distribution of C. partellus we used the climate change scenario A1B obtained from WorldClim and CCAFS databases. The maps were compared with available data on the current distribution of C. partellus in Kenya. The results show that the development times of the different stages decreased with increasing temperatures ranging from 18 to 35 degrees C; at the extreme temperatures, 15 and 38 degrees C, no egg could hatch and no larvae completed development.

J,1,"Kumar, S; Sidhu, JK; Hamm, JC; Kular, JS; Mahal, MS","Phenacoccus solenopsis, the cotton mealy bug, has emerged as a serious pest of cotton in India, necessitating basic studies on its development and survival at different temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) and relative humidities (RH) (65, 75 and 85 +/- 1 %) levels to ascertain optimal population growth. A life table was constructed using temperature and humidity. The nymphal duration was 20.2 d at 35 +/- 1 degrees C and 65 +/- 1% RH, but lengthened to 26.6 days at 20 +/- 1 degrees C and both RH combinations. Adult longevity was 16.4 days at 20 +/- 1 degrees C and 65% RH, but 10.8 days at 35 degrees C at the same RH; however it was 6.4 days at a temperature of 20 +/- 1 degrees C and 75% RH. Fecundity was at its maximum (489 nymphs/female) at 35 +/- 1 degrees C and 65% RH, with lower fecundity at 75% RH across all temperature levels. The net reproductive rate (R-o) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were 141.3 females/female/generation and 1.24 fold per female per day, respectively at 35 +/- 1 degrees C and 65% RH suggesting that the population would increase more than 140 times per generation and 1.24 times per female per day. The rates of increase at higher relative humidities were generally lower than at 65% RH. Nymphs failed to complete development at 85% RH at all temperature levels.

Preoviposition period, oviposition period and female longevity significantly decreased with rising temperature within the temperature range tested. At the respective temperatures adult female lived an average of 294.2, 230.2, 163.6, 141.0, 84.10, and 32.9 d, with average lifetime progeny production of 470, 814, 2,209, 3,619, 2,656, and 338 eggs per female. The net reproductive rates (R-0) were 86.9, 288.0, 869.7, 1,479.7, 989.8, and 107.8 females per female, respectively. Mean daily fecundity (M-x) was modeled as a function of time by using both Enkegaard and Analytis models.

J,1,"Gotoh, T; Suwa, A; Kitashima, Y; Rezk, HA","The spider mite Tetranychus pueraricola infests kudzu vines throughout Japan and causes conspicuous brownish feeding scars. It is possibility that T. pueraricola may get out of hand after invasion of agricultural leguminous crops. To better evaluate its potential severity as a pest, we determined the development, survivorship and life-history parameters of T. pueraricola on kidney bean. At temperatures between 15 and 30 degrees C more than 89% of eggs hatched and of the newly hatched larvae ca. 89% attained maturity. There was no significant difference in eclosion rate of eggs or survival rate of immature stages among the temperatures. The lower threshold temperature from egg to oviposition was 10.9 degrees C and the thermal constant was 147.1 degree-days.
