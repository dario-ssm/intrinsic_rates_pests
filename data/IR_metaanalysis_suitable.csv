Most prior studies of SATP's thermal biology were based on populations from tropical regions, and proved unsuitable for explaining its invasion of large areas of the Palearctic. A more holistic approach to the analysis of its thermal biology is essential background for developing models to assess its invasive potential. Our studies found that SATP has lower and upper thermal thresholds(theta(L) = 5.37 degrees C and theta(U)= 35.69 degrees C, respectively) than South American populations used in prior studies (theta(L)= 7.38 degrees C and theta(U)= 33.82 degrees C). Age-specific life tables were used to estimate the effects of temperature on its demographic parameters. Diapause in SATP had not been characterized prior to our study. We found facultative diapause in pupae developing from larvae exposed to relatively low temperatures (i.e., 2 and 5 degrees C) and short-day length for different exposure periods. The strength of diapause was measured as an increase in post-treatment developmental times of pupae (i.e., degree days) that on average were 2.45-3-fold greater than of pupae reared at favorable temperatures.

The insect is designated a quarantine pest in several countries including Argentina, the main consumer market for bananas produced in southern Brazil. To provide support for the management of O. sacchari, the present study investigated the biology and thermal requirements at eight temperatures (18, 22, 25, 28, 30, 32, 33, and 34 +/- 1 degrees C) and constructed a fertility life table at five temperatures (18, 22, 25, 28, and 30 +/- 1 degrees C).

The lowest and the highest mortality rates in both the eggs and nymph stages were observed at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively. The longest and shortest immature development times were observed at 20 degrees C (53.75 days) and 35 degrees C (18.42 days), respectively. The population growth parameters were significantly affected by the experimental temperatures. The gross reproductive rate (GRR) was severely reduced at 35 degrees C and the net reproductive rate (R-0) was also decreased increasing temperature. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was 0.05, 0.06, 0.06, 0.07 and 0.09 (day(-1)) at 20, 25, 27.5, 30 and 35 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, the lowest finite rate of increase (lambda) (1.05 day(-1)) was observed at 20 degrees C, whereas the longest and shortest mean generation time (T) and doubling time (DT) occurred at 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively. Finally, the highest and lowest reproductive parameters values, including daily and total fecundity and fertility, were obtained at 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C.

The temperatures 10, 30, and 35 degrees C were more lethal than 15, 20, and 25 degrees C. Longevity was highest at 10 degrees C (35.07 +/- 1.38 days). Fertility was nil at 30 degrees C and highest at 20 degrees C (46.36 +/- 1.73 nymphs/female). The stochastic simulation of the models obtained from the precedent biological parameters revealed that the life table parameters of B. brassicae were affected by the temperature. The net reproduction rate was highest at 20 degrees C and lowest at 30 degrees C. The average generation time decreased from 36.85 +/- 1.5 days (15 degrees C) to 6.86 +/- 0.1 days (30 degrees C); the intrinsic rate of increase and the finite rate of increase were highest at 25 degrees C. In general, the life cycle data and mathematical functions obtained in this study clearly illustrate the effect of temperature on the biology of B. brassicae. This knowledge will contribute to predicting the changes that may occur in a population of B.

J,1,"Rendon, D; Buser, J; Tait, G; Lee, JC; Walton, VM",Survival and Fecundity Parameters of Two Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) Morphs on Variable Diet Under Suboptimal Temperatures,"Life history parameters are used to estimate population dynamics, mortality, and reproduction in insects relative to their surrounding environment. For Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae), an invasive agricultural pest, previous studies have estimated net reproductive rate (R.), generation time (T), and intrinsic rate of population increase (rm). A main limitation is that these estimates were measured under relatively favorable settings, and do not reflect environmental conditions and physiological states encountered during dormancy periods. Therefore, this study investigated the impacts of 1) low temperatures and 2) dietary protein: carbohydrate ratios (P:C) on both survival and fecundity parameters of D. suzukii summer morphs (SM) and postoverwintering winter morphs (WM) over physiological age (degree-days, DD). In both morphs, reproductive rates were higher and lifespan was longer when flies were exposed to low protein (P:C 1:4) or carbohydrate-only diets (P:C 0:1) compared with high protein diets (P:C 1:1). WM had higher reproductive rates and longer generation times than SM on optimal 1:4 diet in all trialed temperatures, but at the lowest temperatures, SM had higher reproductive rates than WM in carbohydrate-only and high protein diets.This likely reflected delayed oogenesis and hindered reproduction after an overwintering period in WM receiving suboptimal diets. Oviposition for SM and WM receiving 1:4 diet commenced from 0 to 100 DD, and peaked between 400 and 500 DD, earlier than flies receiving 0:1 diet.

Therefore, this study investigated the impacts of 1) low temperatures and 2) dietary protein: carbohydrate ratios (P:C) on both survival and fecundity parameters of D. suzukii summer morphs (SM) and postoverwintering winter morphs (WM) over physiological age (degree-days, DD). In both morphs, reproductive rates were higher and lifespan was longer when flies were exposed to low protein (P:C 1:4) or carbohydrate-only diets (P:C 0:1) compared with high protein diets (P:C 1:1). WM had higher reproductive rates and longer generation times than SM on optimal 1:4 diet in all trialed temperatures, but at the lowest temperatures, SM had higher reproductive rates than WM in carbohydrate-only and high protein diets.This likely reflected delayed oogenesis and hindered reproduction after an overwintering period in WM receiving suboptimal diets. Oviposition for SM and WM receiving 1:4 diet commenced from 0 to 100 DD, and peaked between 400 and 500 DD, earlier than flies receiving 0:1 diet. These results suggest that dietary protein has a crucial role in early oogenesis, particularly for postoverwintering WM.

Oviposition for SM and WM receiving 1:4 diet commenced from 0 to 100 DD, and peaked between 400 and 500 DD, earlier than flies receiving 0:1 diet.

The effect of temperature on the biology, in particular the duration of the different developmental stages, of this insect pest was examined. The development, survival, and fecundity of H. viriplaca at five different temperatures (22, 25, 28, 31, and 34 degrees C) were investigated, and experimental population life tables calculated. The results show that the developmental time of larvae, pupae, pre-oviposition, adults, and the entire generation decreases with increasing temperature. Larvae emerged fastest from the eggs at 28 degrees C. The percentage of larvae that reached the seventh instar stage was 32.69,38.60,19.67,3.61, and 20.88% at 22, 25, 28,31, and 34 degrees C, respectively. The developmental threshold temperature of the eggs, larvae, pupae, pre-oviposition and total pre-oviposition period was 10.53,12.34,5.60,11.47, and 10.01 degrees C, respectively.

The effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), feeding on maize, Zea mays L., were examined in environmentally controlled chambers. Elevated CO2 decreased N content and increased total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) content and the TNC: N ratio in maize leaves. Developmental time of larvae, protonymphs, deutonymphs, and the entire immature development of T. urticae was reduced at elevated temperatures, while elevated CO2 slightly mitigated the effects of elevated temperature on developmental time. The fecundity of T. urticae declined under elevated CO2 and temperature. Tetranychus urticae had lower net reproductive rate and shorter generation time at elevated temperatures, regardless of CO2 level. These results indicate that elevated CO2-mediated decrease in nutritional quality of maize leaves extends the development time of T. urticae. Taken together, with the increase of CO2 and temperature, the growth and development was accelerated for T. urticae feeding on maize, but its fecundity declined, which will decrease the T. urticae damage to maize for each generation.

Temperature-dependent models were developed using the Insect Life Cycle Modelling software (ILCYM) through a complete life table study at seven constant temperatures in the range 18-32 degrees C. Non-linear functions were fitted to A. thunbergii development, mortality, fecundity and senescence. Model parameters and demographic variables obtained from the models were given for each temperature and development stage. Life table parameters were estimated for nine constant temperatures, from 18 degrees C to 26 degrees C, using stochastic simulations. The minimum temperature threshold (T-min) and the thermal constant (k) for the development from egg to adult were estimated from a linear function at 12.1 degrees C and 666.67 days, respectively.

The effects of constant temperatures on the biology of A. obscurus are not well known. Laboratory studies were conducted to assess the effects of temperature on the development, survival, longevity, fecundity and population parameter of A. obscurus at six constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 32, 35 degrees C). The hatchability was the lowest at 15 degrees C, the highest at 25 degrees C and no eggs hatched at 35 degrees C. Developmental rates increased linearly as the temperature increased. The lower developmental threshold temperature was 10.6 degrees C and 200 degree-days were required to complete development from egg to adult. Adult longevity decreased with increasing temperature, and ranged from 68.87 d at 15 degrees C to 16.41 d at 32 degrees C. The highest total fecundity occurred at 20 degrees C with 162 eggs per female. The temperature-dependent total fecundity, age-specific oviposition rate, and age-specific survival rate models were described. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was significantly higher at 30 and 32 degrees C (0.239 and 0.250) than at other temperatures.

J,1,"Gotoh, T; Moriya, D; Nachman, G",Development and reproduction of five Tetranychus species (Acari: Tetranychidae): Do they all have the potential to become major pests?,"The objective of this study was to investigate whether four spider mite species, Tetranychus ludeni, T. phaselus, T. piercei and T. truncatus, currently with insignificant economic impact, have the potential to achieve the same status as T. urticae, which until now has been considered as the most serious tetranychid pest species in orchards and greenhouses. We investigated the effect of temperature on development, survival and oviposition at 11 constant temperatures ranging from 15 to 40 A degrees C at intervals of 2.5 A degrees C and estimated demographic parameters, such as the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r (m)), for these five species at five constant temperatures. Developmental time from egg to adult (female and male) decreased with increasing temperature from 15 to 32.5 A degrees C in all five species, but increased slightly at 35 A degrees C or higher, especially in T. ludeni and T. urticae. Using linear and non-linear developmental rate models, the lower thermal thresholds for egg-to-adult (female and male) and egg-to-egg development were found to range from 9.8 to 11.7 and from 9.8 to 11.4 A degrees C, respectively. The intrinsic optimal temperature (T (I broken vertical bar)) ranged from 18.0 to 27.4 A degrees C for egg-to-female adult and from 23.9 to 27.2 A degrees C for egg-to-egg development. The oviposition period and adult longevity were strongly affected by temperature. The r (m)-values increased with increasing temperature from 15 to 30 or 35 A degrees C in all five species. The highest r (m)-values at each temperature were 0.114 day(-1) at 15 A degrees C for T. ludeni, 0.199 day(-1) at 20 A degrees C for T. urticae, 0.314 day(-1) at 25 A degrees C for T. ludeni, 0.451 day(-1) at 30 A degrees C for T. ludeni and 0.433 day(-1) at 35 A degrees C for T. truncatus. The total fecundity, net reproductive rate (R (0)) and r (m) of T. ludeni were higher than those of T. urticae at all temperatures. T. piercei and T. truncatus showed higher r (m)-values at 30 and 35 A degrees C than T. urticae.

Females and males developed successfully into adults between 20 degrees C and 36 degrees C. However, no eggs were found at 10 degrees C and all the adults died after exposure to 40 degrees C. The developmental time from egg to adult was higher (170.5 days) at 15 degrees C and lower (76.6 days) at 35 degrees C. Therefore, temperature has a strong effect on the development of S. impressella from 15 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The reproductive period varied between 15-35 degrees C with 6.82 to 3.24 days for pre-oviposition, 17.5 to 4.89 days for oviposition, and 5.29 to 0.82 days for the post-oviposition period. Female longevity was longer than that of the male, at all temperatures. The population growth parameters of S. impressella net reproductive rate (R-0), intrinsic rate increase (r(m)), finite increase rate (lambda), mean generation time (T) and doubling time (D) were significantly affected by temperature.

The established equations for each life age/stage of the species were compiled to obtain an overall temperature-dependent phenology model. The life table parameters of P. solenopsis were estimated using stochastic simulation centred on a rate summation and cohort up-dating approach. The theoretical lower development threshold temperatures estimated using linear regressions applied to mean development rates were 11.2, 8.9, 9.8 and 12.7 degrees C, and the thermal constants for development were 93.7, 129.8, 97.1 and 100.0 degree days (DD) for nymph I, nymph 2, nymph 3 and male pupa stages, respectively. The developed phenology model predicted temperatures between 25 and 35 degrees C as the favourable range for P. solenopsis development, survival and reproduction. P. solenopsis population attained a maximum net reproductive rate (107-108 females/female/generation) and total fecundity (216.6-226.5 individuals/ female/generation) at temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees C.

J,1,"Marchioro, CA; Foerster, LA",Modelling reproduction of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoiptera: Plutellidae): climate change may modify pest incidence levels,"Temperature is considered to be an important abiotic factor influencing insect reproduction. Despite the importance of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) as a pest of brassicaceous crops worldwide, the effects of temperature on its reproduction are not well understood. We evaluated the effect of constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32.5 degrees C on the reproduction of P. xylostella and developed an oviposition model for the species. The model combined temperature-dependent parameters of total fecundity, age-specific oviposition rate and age-specific survival. Additionally, we modelled population growth as a function of temperature. The estimated parameters allowed us to discuss the possible consequences of global warming on P. xylostella distribution. Temperature affected the length of pre-oviposition after adult emergence, oviposition period, longevity, total fecundity and egg viability. The model predicted that both daily egg production and length of oviposition period decreased at temperatures below 15 degrees C and above 25 degrees C.

Preoviposition period, oviposition period and female longevity significantly decreased with rising temperature within the temperature range tested. At the respective temperatures adult female lived an average of 294.2, 230.2, 163.6, 141.0, 84.10, and 32.9 d, with average lifetime progeny production of 470, 814, 2,209, 3,619, 2,656, and 338 eggs per female. The net reproductive rates (R-0) were 86.9, 288.0, 869.7, 1,479.7, 989.8, and 107.8 females per female, respectively. Mean daily fecundity (M-x) was modeled as a function of time by using both Enkegaard and Analytis models. Survivorship data (I,) of adult females were summarized and compared using the shape and scale parameters of the Weibull frequency distribution model across the temperature range tested.

This hypothesis was investigated by assessing the performance of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), an important pest on Crucifers, on the crop plant oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Aphid growth and reproduction was measured at three controlled air temperatures and four watering regimes to induce water deficits. Plant nutritional quality (soluble nitrogen) and microclimate (leaf temperature), both important for aphid growth and reproduction, were determined. With increasing water deficit both soluble nitrogen content (% dry weight) and leaf temperature (degrees C) increased. At all three temperatures development time of the aphid to reproductive age was faster with increasing plant water deficits. Mean relative growth rates and the intrinsic rate of natural increase significantly increased with increasing water deficit at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, and 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees C respectively. Air temperature, leaf temperature, and soluble nitrogen are important factors on aphid growth and reproduction.
