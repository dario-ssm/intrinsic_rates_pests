Most prior studies of SATP's thermal biology were based on populations from tropical regions, and proved unsuitable for explaining its invasion of large areas of the Palearctic. A more holistic approach to the analysis of its thermal biology is essential background for developing models to assess its invasive potential.

Age-specific life tables were used to estimate the effects of temperature on its demographic parameters. Diapause in SATP had not been characterized prior to our study. We found facultative diapause in pupae developing from larvae exposed to relatively low temperatures (i.e., 2 and 5 degrees C) and short-day length for different exposure periods. The strength of diapause was measured as an increase in post-treatment developmental times of pupae (i.e., degree days) that on average were 2.45-3-fold greater than of pupae reared at favorable temperatures.

Due to mite inability to settle on leaf disk, almond young branches were used for conducting life table experiments. Our results indicated that higher and lower temperatures caused a steeper decline in survivorship. The highest survival rate was observed at 25 and 27 degrees C. The mean total development time was significantly decreased with increasing the temperatures; while adult longevity for both female and males significantly decreased. Furthermore, offspring production did not occur at 35 degrees C. The highest values of the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were 0.2563 and 1.2922 d(-1) at 27 degrees C, while their lowest values were obtained at 13 degrees C. Again high temperature (30 degrees C) caused a decline in both the reproductive rate and growth rate of this mite species. The longest mean generation time (T) (58.55 d) was at 13 degrees C and it declined significantly with increasing temperature. The most striking result emerging from our data is that 27 degrees C is the most desirable temperature for not only development but also the reproduction of S. smirnovi.

Our study aims to provide information on the pest biology as influenced by temperature, determine thermal thresholds, and provide life table parameters for M. leuconotus reared in the laboratory. The life cycle of M. leuconotus was studied at seven constant temperatures in the range 15-35 degrees C, with 80 +/- 5% RH and a photoperiod of L:D 12:12. Linear and nonlinear models were fitted to laboratory data to describe the impact of temperature on M. leuconotus development, mortality, fecundity and senescence. The complete life cycle was obtained between 18 and 30 degrees C, with the egg incubation period ranging 10.8-29.2 days. The development time was longest for the larva, with 194.2 days at 30 degrees C and 543.1 days at 18 degrees C. The minimum temperature threshold (T-min) was estimated at 10.7, 10.0 and 11.5 degrees C, for egg, larva and pupa, respectively. The maximum temperature threshold (T-max) was estimated at 37.4, 40.6 and 40.0 degrees C for egg, larva and pupa, respectively. The optimum temperature for immature stage survival was estimated between 23.0 and 23.9 degrees C. The highest fecundity was 97.8 eggs per female at 23 degrees C. Simulated life table parameters showed the highest net reproductive rate (R-0) of 11.8 daughters per female at 26 degrees C and maximal intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) between 26 and 28 degrees C, with a value of 0.008.

The methods are used to identify the variable(s) that have the largest influence on lambda. Tetranychus urticae Koch is one of the most polyphagous tetranychid mites which has been collected from plenty plant species including agricultural and horticultural crops. In this study, sensitivity and elasticity analyses were used to investigate the effects of various demographic variables on lambda at five different temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), using both age- and stage-structured matrix models. Considering the sensitivity of lambda to age-dependent fecundity rates (f(x)), it was found that starting oviposition one day earlier was associated with the highest sensitivity compared to the other age classes, irrespective of temperature. Besides, results from both age- and stage-structured matrix models indicated that lambda is more sensitive to changes in survival rates than in fecundity rates at all temperatures. Furthermore, female individuals at the ages of 46, 23, 14, 11 and 7 days had the highest contribution to population growth in comparison with other ages, when reared at the above-mentioned temperatures, respectively. Also, the sensitivity of lambda to the changes in survival of adults was higher than in other stages. Besides, the elasticity to fecundity rate at the age of first reproduction was considerably higher than those associated with the age of last reproduction. The survival rates (s(i)) generally exhibited a higher elasticity than the transition rates (g(i)). Overall, adult survival had the highest influence on lambda followed by immature survival, egg survival, and female fecundity. Consequently, management efforts that aim at decreasing adult survival are likely to yield the best results with regard to reducing the growth rate of T. urticae.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,,,,,,,Acari>Prostigmata,Tetranychidae,Tetranychus,urticae,sucker,eggplant,Solanaceae,eggplant,Solanaceae,55,no,16,Ahvaz (Iran),31.33378,48.86386,,10.11158/saa.25.2.8,SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1362-1971,NA,2020,,WOS:000518191300008

Crucially, the tri-trophic responses of plants, herbivores and their natural enemies to warming are poorly understood. To delineate these interactive properties, a three-system approach and integrating life table methodology were used to examine the responses of wheat plants, English grain aphid and parasitoids under open-field infrared heating to simulate warming. RESULTSWarming significantly increased wheat biomass and grain weight, causing a phenological shift in plant growth. Importantly, warming significantly increased the number of aphids and the reproductive period, coupled with a higher net reproductive rate and intrinsic growth rate. Otherwise, duration of development, generation span, and population doubling time all decreased significantly. Warming had no effect on parasitoid abundance but resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of parasitism. CONCLUSIONWarming may strengthen bottom-up effects on aphids by increasing wheat biomass, resulting in reduced regulation of aphid populations. Warming had a different effect on parasitoids between 2015 and 2016.

J,1,"Ghazy, NA; Gotoh, T; Suzuki, T",Impact of global warming scenarios on life-history traits of Tetranychus evansi (Acari: Tetranychidae),"Background The tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard (Acari: Tetranychidae), is an agricultural pest of solanaceous crops. Although T. evansi is of South American subtropical origin, it has recently expanded its distribution range to many tropical and temperate areas around the world. Its potential distribution range in response to scenarios of global warming was recently modeled, confirming its current and possible future distributions. Here, we experimentally investigated the biological traits of T. evansi in the context of the current and future global warming (2100) scenarios. Using an environmental simulation system, we tested the life-history traits of T. evansi under current summer temperatures (as of June, July, and August 2016) and under expected temperature increases based on two IPCC scenarios: RCP2.6 (+ 1 degrees C) and RCP8.5 (+ 3.7 degrees C). The mites were introduced into each scenario on 1 June and their sequential progeny were used for testing in each following month. Results The mite could develop and reproduce under all scenarios. There was a decrease in the duration of lifespan and female fecundity at RCP8.5 during June and August, but this may be compensated for by the high intrinsic rate of increase, which implies faster population growth and shorter generation time. Conclusion Our study and other reports reveal the high adaptability of T. evansi to a wide range of summer temperatures; this may explain its current distribution. We anticipate that global warming will favor the spread of T. evansi and may further expand its distribution to a large area of the globe.

Global warming is occurring at an unprecedented rate. Information about how variable temperature affects insect life-history traits is still scarce. 2. The current study first evaluated the effects of two variable-temperature treatments [high-temperature-variation (HT) treatments and mild-temperature-variation (MT) treatments] on the life-history traits of a maternal generation (F-0) of Rhopalosiphum padi, a serious global pest, using a constant normal-temperature (NT) treatment as a control. Following this, the life-history traits of the offspring generation (F-1) under the NT, MT and HT scenarios were analysed. 3. The total developmental duration of the aphid F-0 generation was significantly shortened by MT treatments, while it was significantly increased by HT treatments. Adult longevity and the fecundity of F-0 were significantly decreased by HT treatments compared with those in the MT and NT treatments, whereas no significant difference was found between the latter two treatments. The HT treatments applied to the F-0 generation significantly prolonged the total developmental duration of the F-1 generation. The offspring adult longevity was not affected by the mothers' temperature experience. The offspring fecundity was significantly increased when the F-0 generation experienced MT treatments. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was significantly decreased when the F-0 generation experienced an HT scenario. However, the MT scenario experienced by the F-0 generation did not significantly affect the r(m) of their offspring. 4. The results will provide new insights into the effects of variable maternal temperature on the individual development and population dynamics of offspring under a global warming scenario.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,,,solo fluctuante vs constante,10.1111/een.12796,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0307-6946,1365-2311,2020,,WOS:000485228200001

As the citrus rust damage has intensified in recent years and T. brunneus has been reported in high population levels in several regions of Brazil, this mite has caused concern to growers and technicians. Because T. brunneus has been little studied and its bioecological characteristics are unknown, this study investigated the biological and demographic parameters of T. brunneus on citrus fruits under laboratory conditions. Our results showed that the egg incubation period and viability were 3.0 and 94.5%, respectively. The larval and nymphal stage durations were 1.1 and 2.8 days, respectively. The development time of the immature stage was 6.9 days, with 92.3% survival. When females and males were maintained together, the sex ratio of offspring was 0.7; virgin females produced only males. The pre-oviposition (from adult emergence to the first egg) and total pre-oviposition (egg-to-egg) periods were 1.6 and 8.5 days, respectively. Fecundity was 8.5 eggs, and female and male longevities were 13.2 and 11.4 days, respectively. The estimate of demographic parameters indicated that the R-o and T of T. brunneus were 6.45 offspring and 13.0 days, and r and lambda were 0.142 and 1.153 day(-1), respectively. These results suggest that T. brunneus has high growth potential on citrus trees.

The effect of six ambient temperatures (17, 20, 25, 30, 33 and 36 degrees C) on life table parameters of R. ficifoliae was studied under laboratory conditions at 60 +/- 5% relative humidity and a photoperiod of 16: 8 h (L: D) on fig leaves. The life table parameters were estimated according to the age-stage, two-sex life table theory. In addition, the bootstrap technique was used for estimating the variances and standard errors of the population parameters. R. ficifoliae successfully developed and reproduced from 17 to 33 degrees C, but the females reared at 36 degrees C laid a few eggs and died after several days. The longest and shortest total longevity of females were recorded at 25 degrees C (48.50 days) and 33 degrees C (14.33 days), respectively. The fecundity increased as temperature increased from 11.04 eggs at 17 degrees C to 25.04 eggs at 25 degrees C, then decreased and reached 12.44 eggs at 33 degrees C.

The duration of each instar and the longevity of this insect were inversely proportional to the temperature, regardless of sex. The nymph stage of T. peregrinus was 36.4 days at 18 degrees C and 16.1 days at 30 degrees C. The pre-oviposition period was 5.1 days at 30 degrees C and 13.1 days at 18 degrees C and that of oviposition was 7.6 days at 30 degrees C and 51.2 days at 22 degrees C. The generation time (T) of T. peregrinus was 27.11 days at 22 degrees C and 8.22 days at 30 degrees C. Lower temperatures reduced the development and increased the life stage duration of T. peregrinus. Optimum temperatures for T. peregrinus development and reproduction were 18 and 25 degrees C, respectively.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,30,-0.084,0.063,Euler-Lotka,bootstrap,23,Ny-adult,Hemiptera,Thaumastocoridae,Thaumastocoris,peregrinus,sucker,eucalyptus,Myrtaceae,eucalyptus,Myrtaceae,70,yes,12,Colombo (Brazil),-25.29254,-49.22435,n de fase nymph-adult,10.1038/s41598-019-45663-5,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2045-2322,NA,2019,,WOS:000475467800017

Frankliniella occidentalis and Thrips hawaiiensis are sympatric pests on flower and vegetable host plants in China. This study evaluated the influence of constant (23.0 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures (average of 23.0 degrees C) on the population development of these two species. The results showed that both of these pests showed faster development and higher fecundity at a constant temperature than at fluctuating temperatures when fed on Rosa rugosa flowers, and F. occidentalis showed faster development and higher fecundity than T. hawaiiensis under both conditions. Under the constant and fluctuating temperatures, the development times from egg to adult were 9.57 and 10.62 day for F. occidentalis and 10.71 and 11.82 day for T. hawaiiensis, respectively. The total numbers of first instar nymph produced were 103.08 and 86.32 by F. occidentalis, 86.96 and 73.32 by T. hawaiiensis, under the constant and fluctuating temperatures, respectively, and a higher intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) (0.173 and 0.160) and R-0 (46.31 and 36.86) were obtained in F. occidentalis compared with T. hawaiiensis (r(m) for 0.154 and 0.141 and R-0 for 34.46 and 27.81, respectively). Our results indicate that the constant temperature had a positive effect on the population development of both F. occidentalis and T. hawaiiensis. Furthermore, F. occidentalis showed a stronger adaptability over T. hawaiiensis at both constant and fluctuating temperatures, according to its faster development and higher fecundity. These results may contribute to the better understanding of the biology of different thrip species, especially the interspecific competition between invasive and native thrips under the changing environment.

Each one-day-old male was put in contact with a female quiescent deutonymph daily to determine how many times a male could copulate after the deutonymph became an adult. With all temperatures and RH's, mortality was evenly distributed throughout the observations. Developmental rate, reproduction, and, consequently, parameters of population increase were significantly associated with temperature. The highest rate of population increase took place at 27.5 degrees C and 40-40 RH. By itself, RH did not significantly affect those variables, although its extreme values showed slight negative effects. Approximately four females per male were observed. Males copulated with 4.56 females on average; this suggests that between 20 and 30 % of the males are enough to fertilize all females present.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,30,0.0614,no,Euler-Lotka,bootstrap,23,n hembras,Acari>Trombidiformes,Tenuipalpidae,Raoiella,indica,sucker,coconut,Arecaceae,coconut,Arecaceae,various,yes,12,Veracruz (Mexico),19.18379,-96.21515,,10.25100/socolen.v45i1.7810,REVISTA COLOMBIANA DE ENTOMOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0120-0488,NA,2019,,WOS:000496548400004
J,1,"Sanchez-Ramos, I; Gomez-Casado, E; Fernandez, CE; Gonzalez-Nunez, M",Reproductive potential and population increase of Drosophila suzukii at constant temperatures,"The invasive species Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) represents a serious problem in Europe and America for the production of a wide variety of small fruits. Originally endemic to Southeast Asia, it is able to attack healthy ripening fruit where females lay eggs with its serrated ovipositor. The main factor determining population increase of this fly is temperature. Different studies have focused on the effect of this factor on reproduction of American and Asian populations. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted to date on European populations. The effect of eight constant temperatures (13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 27, 29 and 30 degrees C) on reproduction, adult survival and life table parameters of a Spanish population was modelled. The highest fecundity (341.3 eggs/female) and daily fecundity (11.6 eggs/female/day) were obtained at 22 degrees C. Egg laying decreased below and above this temperature until the lowest values were obtained at extreme temperatures. Conversely, decreasing values of oviposition period and adult longevity were registered for increasing temperatures. A non-linear Briere model predicted at 9.8 and 30.6 degrees C the lower and upper thresholds for population increase, determining a wider range than that previously reported for this species. The predicted optimum temperature for population increase was 25.3 degrees C. The intrinsic rates of population increase obtained are among the highest described for this fly. These results could be an additional tool to be included into demographic models to predict population dynamics of this pest.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,,,,,,,Diptera,Drosophilidae,Drosophila,suzukii,borer,,,apple?,,,no,,,,,no accesible,10.1127/entomologia/2019/0794,ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0171-8177,2363-7102,2019,,WOS:000494279500005
J,1,"Ishihara, Y; Tagami, Y",Effect of Temperature on Development and Reproduction of Bradysia sp. and Bradysia impatiens (Diptera: Sciaridae),"Since 2014, some Welsh onion and carrot fields have been damaged by Bradysia sp., dark-winged fungus gnat (Diptera: Sciaridae), in the northern region of Saitama Prefecture, Japan. Bradysia impatiens (Johannsen) are also known as important insect pests in various crops. In the present study, we examined the effects of temperature on the development and reproduction of Bradysia sp. and B. impatiens reared on rice bran at constant temperatures of 11, 16, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C. The developmental periods from egg to adult emergence of Bradysia sp. were longer than those of B. impatiens at all temperatures. In Bradysia sp., 112.8 days and 26.6 days were required for development of adult females at 11 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively, in comparison with 93.3 days and 21.4 days for B. impatiens. The intrinsic rates of natural increase at 11, 16, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C of Bradysia sp. were -0.006, 0.023, 0.043, 0.100, and -0.030 and those of B. impatiens were 0.004, 0.058, 0.103, 0.111, and 0.062, respectively.

For Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae), an invasive agricultural pest, previous studies have estimated net reproductive rate (R.), generation time (T), and intrinsic rate of population increase (rm). A main limitation is that these estimates were measured under relatively favorable settings, and do not reflect environmental conditions and physiological states encountered during dormancy periods. Therefore, this study investigated the impacts of 1) low temperatures and 2) dietary protein: carbohydrate ratios (P:C) on both survival and fecundity parameters of D. suzukii summer morphs (SM) and postoverwintering winter morphs (WM) over physiological age (degree-days, DD). In both morphs, reproductive rates were higher and lifespan was longer when flies were exposed to low protein (P:C 1:4) or carbohydrate-only diets (P:C 0:1) compared with high protein diets (P:C 1:1). WM had higher reproductive rates and longer generation times than SM on optimal 1:4 diet in all trialed temperatures, but at the lowest temperatures, SM had higher reproductive rates than WM in carbohydrate-only and high protein diets.This likely reflected delayed oogenesis and hindered reproduction after an overwintering period in WM receiving suboptimal diets. Oviposition for SM and WM receiving 1:4 diet commenced from 0 to 100 DD, and peaked between 400 and 500 DD, earlier than flies receiving 0:1 diet.

These changes will influence the growth of both crop plants and herbivores. The effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), feeding on maize, Zea mays L., were examined in environmentally controlled chambers. Elevated CO2 decreased N content and increased total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) content and the TNC: N ratio in maize leaves. Developmental time of larvae, protonymphs, deutonymphs, and the entire immature development of T. urticae was reduced at elevated temperatures, while elevated CO2 slightly mitigated the effects of elevated temperature on developmental time. The fecundity of T. urticae declined under elevated CO2 and temperature. Tetranychus urticae had lower net reproductive rate and shorter generation time at elevated temperatures, regardless of CO2 level. These results indicate that elevated CO2-mediated decrease in nutritional quality of maize leaves extends the development time of T. urticae. Taken together, with the increase of CO2 and temperature, the growth and development was accelerated for T. urticae feeding on maize, but its fecundity declined, which will decrease the T. urticae damage to maize for each generation.

Determination of the pest's population life table parameters is essential for understanding population development and growth under a variety of climates and as part of a pest risk analysis. The development, mortality and reproduction were studied in two pest populations (from Peru and Ecuador) in which cohorts of each life stage were exposed to different constant temperatures ranging from 10 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Using the Insect Life Cycle Modeling software, nonlinear equations were fitted to the data and an overall phenology model established to simulate life table parameters based on temperature. The temperature-dependent development curve was statistically well described for eggs by Ratkowsky's model and for larvae and pupae by Taylor's model. Variability in development time among individuals independent of temperature was significantly described by a log-logistic model. Temperature effects on immature mortality were described using different nonlinear models. Optimal temperature for survival was between 14 degrees and 17 degrees C. Temperature effects on adult senescence and oviposition time were described by simple exponential models; within-group variability was described by a Weibull distribution function. Fecundity per female due to temperature followed a nonlinear model indicating maximum reproduction at similar to 17 degrees C. The established model revealed good convergence with historical life tables established at fluctuating temperatures. The results confirm that S.tangolias is more adapted to cooler temperature than the common potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller). S.tangolias develops at temperatures within the range of 8-28.8 degrees C with a maximum finite rate of population increase (=1.053) at 21 degrees C.

The temperature-dependent development curve was statistically well described for eggs by Ratkowsky's model and for larvae and pupae by Taylor's model. Variability in development time among individuals independent of temperature was significantly described by a log-logistic model. Temperature effects on immature mortality were described using different nonlinear models. Optimal temperature for survival was between 14 degrees and 17 degrees C. Temperature effects on adult senescence and oviposition time were described by simple exponential models; within-group variability was described by a Weibull distribution function. Fecundity per female due to temperature followed a nonlinear model indicating maximum reproduction at similar to 17 degrees C. The established model revealed good convergence with historical life tables established at fluctuating temperatures. The results confirm that S.tangolias is more adapted to cooler temperature than the common potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller).

The results showed that the developmental time of egg, larva, pupa, and adult decreased when temperature increased from 17 degrees C to 33 degrees C. The TPOP (total preoviposition period) decreased with temperature increasing from 17 degrees C to 29 degrees C, while the longest APOP (adult preoviposition period) occurred at 21 degrees C (3.57d) and the shortest at 33 degrees C (2.15d).

Nymphs and adults feed on all vegetative and fruiting parts of the coffee tree leading to yield reduction and poor quality of coffee beans. Our study aimed to characterize the developmental biology and provide life table parameters for A. thunbergii reared in the laboratory. The biology of A. thunbergii was studied at four constant temperatures of 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C with 80 +/- 5% RH and a photoperiod of L:D 12:12. Complete development of A. thunbergii from egg to adult occurred between 20 and 30 degrees C, while eggs did not hatch at 35 degrees C. Immature stage development time decreased significantly with an increase in temperature, with the exception of fifth nymphal stage, duration of which was similar for all temperatures. The fecundity was maximal at 20 degrees C with an average of 132.8 eggs per female and 1.7 egg per female per day. The gross reproductive rate (GRR) was the highest at 20 degrees C with 75.79 daughters per female compared to 19.56 and 2.69 daughters per female at 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively.

The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), and net reproductive rate (R-0) increased initially at low temperatures and then decreased. All metrics reached a maximum at 27 degrees C and a minimum at 36 degrees C. Mean generation times (T) decreased across the temperature range with a minimum at 36 degrees C.

J,1,"Silva, DB; Bueno, VHP; Lins, JC; van Lenteren, JC",Life history data and population growth of Tuta absoluta at constant and alternating temperatures on two tomato lines,"The tomato borer Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae), is of growing concern worldwide as a key pest of tomato. In Brazil, the pest is controlled by frequent pesticide sprays, leading to quick development of pesticide resistance in the pest, to high pesticide residue levels on the fruit and to decimation of natural enemies of this and other tomato pests. In order to develop biological control programs, basic information on the biology of the pest T. absoluta is essential. In addition, potential occurrence of resistance to the pest in tomato lines might be an interesting option for control of the pest, either alone or in combination with biological control. Therefore, we studied development, sex ratio, weight, fecundity and population growth of T. absoluta at constant (25 degrees C) and alternating temperature (30/20 degrees C) on two tomato lines (Bravo and Tex 317), which were expected to have different levels of resistance to the tomato borer. Tomato line and temperature regime significantly influenced many life history parameters. Development time was generally shorter and emergence rates higher on Bravo than on Tex 317. However, egg development time was similar on both tomato lines and temperature regimes, though egg survival was much lower on Tex 317. Also larval survival was lower on Tex 317, and this lower egg and larval survival suggests antibiosis resistance. Interestingly, the sex ratio was more female biased at the alternating than at the constant temperature on both tomato lines. Another temperature effect was a longer egg to adult development time on both lines at the alternating temperature regime. The net reproductive rate (R-0) and the intrinsic rate of population increase (rm) were higher on Bravo than on Tex 317, again indicating that Bravo is the most suitable host plant of the two. On the partially resistant tomato line Tex 317 population development is estimated to be much slower than on line Bravo. Also, T. absoluta larvae are exposed longer to natural enemies on Tex 317. Possibilities for biological control of this pest are discussed.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70,no,12,Lavras (Brazil),-21.24255,-44.9992,solo fluctuante vs constante,NA,BULLETIN OF INSECTOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1721-8861,NA,2015,,WOS:000364491800009

Temperature is the most effective ecological factors on demography and life cycle of arthropods. The effect of temperature on the reproduction and population growth parameters of this pest was investigated in current study. Experiments were conducted at four constant temperatures 25, 27.5, 30 and 32.5 (+/- 1) degrees C, on Ohadi cultivar in the laboratory. Based on the results, the immature development times were calculated as 56.37 +/- 0.53, 47.72 +/- 0.70, 42.03 +/- 0.39 and 39.10 +/- 0.46 days at 25, 27.5, 30 and 32.5 degrees C, respectively. The highest net fecundity rate was 25.34 eggs/female at 27.5 degrees C. although no significant difference was observed between 27.5 and 30 degrees C. Mean daily number of eggs laid by a female was the greatest at 30 degrees C. The gross reproductive rate (GRR) and net reproductive rate (R-0) of A. komaroffi were higher at 30 and 27.5 degrees C. The highest intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was calculated as 0.056 at 30 degrees C. Similarly no significant difference was observed in r(m) values between 27.5 and 30 degrees C. The higher finite rates of increase (lambda) ware achieved at 27.5 and 30 degrees C. The longest mean generation time (T) was 59.9 days at 25 degrees C. Pest generation time decreased significantly with increasing temperature from 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C. Regarding the results, development and population increase of A. komaroffi at 27.5 and 30 degrees C were more rapidly performed and this knowledge could be valuable in its monitoring and control.

Experiments were conducted at four constant temperatures 25, 27.5, 30 and 32.5 (+/- 1) degrees C, on Ohadi cultivar in the laboratory. Based on the results, the immature development times were calculated as 56.37 +/- 0.53, 47.72 +/- 0.70, 42.03 +/- 0.39 and 39.10 +/- 0.46 days at 25, 27.5, 30 and 32.5 degrees C, respectively. The highest net fecundity rate was 25.34 eggs/female at 27.5 degrees C. although no significant difference was observed between 27.5 and 30 degrees C. Mean daily number of eggs laid by a female was the greatest at 30 degrees C. The gross reproductive rate (GRR) and net reproductive rate (R-0) of A. komaroffi were higher at 30 and 27.5 degrees C. The highest intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was calculated as 0.056 at 30 degrees C. Similarly no significant difference was observed in r(m) values between 27.5 and 30 degrees C. The higher finite rates of increase (lambda) ware achieved at 27.5 and 30 degrees C. The longest mean generation time (T) was 59.9 days at 25 degrees C. Pest generation time decreased significantly with increasing temperature from 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C. Regarding the results, development and population increase of A. komaroffi at 27.5 and 30 degrees C were more rapidly performed and this knowledge could be valuable in its monitoring and control.

The rate of population increase per unit time (r(m)) (day) ranged from 0.0033 (15 degrees C) to 0.1995 (28 degrees C). The highest values of r(m) were recorded at temperatures of 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The rm values were a good fit to the models tested, with R-2 > 0.91 and R-adj(2) > 0.88. The models tested (Davidson, Sharpe and DeMichele modified by Schoolfield et al., Logan et al., Lamb, and Briere et al.) were very good fits for the rm values observed, with R-2 > 0.91 and R-adj(2) > 0.88. The only exception was the Davidson model. Of the parameters studied, the reproductive capacity was higher in the apterous aphids, with the unique exception of daily fecundity at 28 degrees C, which was higher in the alate aphids of H. foeniculi. Parameters relating to the age-specific fertility table for H. foeniculi were heavily influenced by temperature, with the highest biotic potential and population growth capacity found at 34 degrees C. Therefore, the results obtained in this study could be of practical significance for predicting outbreaks of fennel aphids and improving the management of this aphid in fennel crops.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,30,0.1758,no,Euler-Lotka,bootstrap,200,4 bloques x 50 adultos/bloquie,Hemiptera,Aphididae,Hyadaphis,foeniculi,sucker,fennel,Apiaceae,fennel,Apiaceae,70,yes,12,Paraiba (Brazil),-7.12194,-36.72468,,10.1371/journal.pone.0122490,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,2015,,WOS:000353713100009

A thorough understanding of pest biology is essential for development of a reliable pest population prediction system and management strategies, but little is known about this pest. Therefore, we quantified the development, fecundity, fertility, longevity, morphometrics (length, width, and hind tibia length of adults), and other life table parameters of L.invasa in relation to temperature and to provide an experimental basis for developing an overall wasp population model. The results showed that ranging from 20 to 32 degrees C (five constant temperatures were 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C, respectively), the developmental period of immatures (egg to adult) was shortest at 29 degrees C but longest at 20 degrees C; the number of eggs per female in the oviduct and survival rate of immatures were greatest at 29 degrees C but smallest at 32 degrees C. The effect of temperature on morphometrics was more pronounced for females than males. When L.invasa was fed with a 40% honey solution, maximum longevity was at 23 degrees C (9.0 days for females and 12.8 days for males). The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) was largest (0.0477) at 29 degrees C, and the sex ratio of L.invasa was extremely female-biased. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) indicates that L.invasa population growth is likely to be greatest at 29 degrees C. The developmental zero temperature (t) and the effective cumulative temperature (k) of egg, larva and pupa were 13.0, 19.7 and 17.1 degrees C, and 128.1, 284.2 and 201.2 degrees C, respectively. For L.invasa, 19.1 degrees C (t) and 563.5 degrees C (k) were indispensable for completing development from egg to adult. Therefore, farmers or managers of forests could predict the population dynamics of the wasp and adopt physical or chemical methods to control it according to the temperature.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,,,"no (galler, not herbivore)",10.1111/aen.12094,AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2052-1758,2052-174X,2015,,WOS:000349398700005

Merrill, in Asia recently invaded North America and has become not only an important pest of soybean but also a nuisance pest. Although much is reported about M. cribraria in its native and invasive range, little information has been documented on the effect of temperatures on its development, longevity, and reproduction. We evaluated the influence of five constant temperatures (17-33 degrees C) on the development, survival, fecundity, and population growth of M. cribraria in the laboratory. The developmental time for egg and nymph stages was shortened significantly with increasing temperature. The developmental time from egg to adult emergence was 114.81, 76.26, 44.54, and 38.54 d at 17, 21, 25, and 29 degrees C, respectively. The nymphs of M. cribraria could not complete full development at a constant 33 degrees C. The developmental threshold temperature estimated for egg to adult was 14.25 degrees C, with a thermal constant of 849.56 degree-days. Females had the longest preoviposition period at 21 degrees C (54.33 d), and the preoviposition period was shortened significantly as the temperature increased. Females had the longest oviposition period (35.33 d) and the highest fecundity (159.67 eggs per female) at 25 degrees C and did not lay any eggs at 17 degrees C. Female longevity was found to be shortest (44.0 d) at 29 degrees C, and similar (75.67-81.50 d) at 17-25 degrees C. The population trend index of M. cribraria was the highest (46.47) at 25 degrees C, followed by 29 degrees C (10.84) and 21 degrees C (6.70).

This study involved I. the construction of life tables of S. litura at six constant temperatures viz., 20, 25, 27, 30, 33 and 35 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C reared on peanut (Arachis hypogaea L) grown under eCO(2) (550 ppm) concentration in open top chambers ii. Estimation of threshold temperatures and thermal constants and iii. Prediction of the pest scenarios during near and distant future climate change periods. Significantly lower leaf nitrogen, higher carbon and a higher relative proportion of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) were observed in peanut foliage grown under eCO(2) over ambient CO2 (aCO(2)). The mean development time (days) of each stage, egg, larva, pupa, pre-oviposition and total life span decreased from 20 to 35 degrees C temperature on eCO(2) foliage. The thermal requirement of S. litura from egg to egg (within the range of 20 degrees C-35 degrees C) was 538.5 DD on eCO(2) as against 494.5 DD on aCO(2) foliage. Finite (lambda) and intrinsic rates of increase (r(m)), net reproductive rate (R-o), mean generation time (T) and doubling time (DT) of S. litura varied significantly with temperature and CO2 and were found to have quadratic relationships with temperature. The present results on life table parameters estimated by the bootstrap technique showed that the 'r(m)' values of S. litura on eCO(2) foliage were higher than those in the literature indicating a significant influence of eCO(2). The reduction of 'T was noticed from a maximum of 50 days at 20 degrees C to minimum of 22 days at 35 degrees C and 'lambda' which is the indicator of reproductive value of new eggs was highest at 35 degrees C and showed a negative relationship with temperature. The data on these life table parameters were plotted against temperature and two non-linear models developed for both CO2 conditions and used for predicting the pest scenarios. Prediction of pest scenarios based on PRECIS A1B emission scenario data at eleven peanut growing locations of the country during near future (NF) and distant future (DF) climate change periods showed an increase of 'r(m)' and 'lambda' with varied 'R-o' and reduced 'T.

We used six thermal regimens to simulate NTs on hot days and investigated the effects of night warming on life-history traits of the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. Experimental temperatures fluctuated in continuous diurnal cycles, increasing from 27 degrees C to a maximum 35 degrees C and then declining to 27 degrees C gradually before further dropping to different minima (13, 16, 19, 21, 23 or 25 degrees C) representing NTs.

The present study, conducted at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad, India, aimed at 1) construction of life tables at six constant temperatures viz., 20, 25, 27, 30, 33, and 35 +/- 0.5(degrees)C for Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera) reared on sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) grown under ambient and elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) (550 ppm) concentration in open top chambers and 2) prediction of the pest status in near future (NF) and distant future (DF) climate change scenarios at major sunflower growing locations of India. Significantly lower leaf nitrogen, higher carbon and higher relative proportion of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) were observed in sunflower foliage grown under eCO(2) over ambient.

Finite (lambda) and intrinsic rates of increase (r(m)), net reproductive rate (R-o), mean generation time, (T) and doubling time (DT) of S. litura increased significantly with temperature up to 27-30(degrees)C and declined with further increase in temperature.

The biology of D. neobrevipes including its development, survivorship, longevity and reproduction was investigated at six constant temperatures (17, 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C) under laboratory conditions. Results indicated that the developmental periods of D. neobrevipes females (from the first instar nymph to adult) shortened from 55.4 days at 17 degrees C to 16.9 days at 29 degrees C, while the males' decreased from 54.0 days at 17 degrees C to 15.8 days at 32 degrees C. The highest survivorship of D. neobrevipes from the first instar nymph to adult was recorded at 29 degrees C; 88.8% for females and 89.2% for males. The average longevity of females was 95.0 days at 17 degrees C, but decreased to 30.0 days at 26 degrees C. This was still significantly longer than those of males; 5.6 days at 17 degrees C and 2.3 days at 32 degrees C. The average number of nymphs laid per female increased with increasing temperature and reached a maximum of 409.4 nymphs at 23 degrees C. The intrinsic rates of increase (r(m)) of D. neobrevipes at the range of temperatures between 17 and 32 degrees C were 0.0287, 0.0613, 0.0941, 0.1131, 0.1202 and 0.0485, respectively.

AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES,"Tetranychus merganser is a mite species that causes greater economic damage in the papaya (Carica papaya) production area in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Therefore, it was necessary to study their biology in order to make better decisions in their management. We obtained a colony of mites from a female collected in the municipality of Manlio E Altamirano, and expanded their population on bean leaves (Phaseolus vulgaris) under greenhouse conditions. The objective was to evaluate the influence of temperature on the population parameters of this species and the duration of their developmental stages. For this purpose, we established cohorts starting with eggs, and exposed them to the following conditions: constant temperatures (19, 23, 27, 31, 33 and 35 degrees C); 60 +/- 2 % relative humidity, photoperiod of 14:10 h light:dark, and fed with papaya leaf discs. The duration of the life cycle of T merganser decreased from 52.3 to 12.9 d with the increase of temperature. The net reproductive rate (R-o) was 37.40, 62.38, 43.98, 10.47 and 2.32 for 19, 23, 27, 31 and 33 degrees C; at 35 degrees C, the cohort was not viable. The intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) was 0.08, 0.19, 0.21, 0.18 and 0.12 at the temperatures recorded. Optimal development occurred between 23 and 27 C.

The demography of A. yasumatsui was studied in the laboratory based on the age-stage, two-sex life table at 20, 23, 25, 28, and 31 degrees C, 70% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 16: 8 (L:D) h. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) under these temperatures was 0.06, 0.07, 0.09, 0.10, and 0.08 d(-1), respectively. The net reproductive rate (R-0) was 46.27, 47.78, 69.50, 96.08, and 56.65 offsprings per individual and the mean generation time (T) was 65.60, 55.81, 47.82, 44.15, and 51.42 d, respectively. A. yasumatsui does well at warmer temperatures (25-28 degrees C); however, its performance is disrupted at lower temperatures. This study provides insight on how to minimize growth and destruction of A. yasumatsui and conservation of Cy. taitungensis; new cycad reserves should be set up in cooler areas in Taiwan.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,,,no (no cultivo),10.1603/EC11318,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0022-0493,1938-291X,2012,,WOS:000312443000014

The aim of this study was to determine the thermal requirements for aphid development and to assess its performance on six grapevine cultivars of economic importance in Greece. The grapevine aphid was reared at four constant temperatures (17 - 26 degrees C) on 'Soultanina' and 'Agiorgitiko' cultivars and the thermal summation method was applied to estimate the lower developmental thresholds and the thermal constants in each cultivar. In addition, age-specific life tables were constructed and population growth parameters on cultivars 'Soultanina', 'Savvatiano', 'Moscato Bianco', 'Agiorgitiko', 'Mavrodafni' and 'Merlot' were estimated at 23 degrees C. Our data revealed that aphids develop faster with increasing temperatures within the 17 - 26 degrees C range on both cultivars. The theoretical lower developmental threshold was 4.2 degrees C and 5.4 degrees C and 110.9 and 104.1 day-degrees were required for aphids to reach adulthood on 'Soultanina' and 'Agiorgitiko', respectively. Mean adult longevity and mean post-reproductive period varied significantly among cultivars. Aphids lived significantly longer on 'Savvatiano' than on 'Moscato Bianco', 'Soultanina' and 'Mavrodafni', and the longest post-reproductive period were recorded for aphids reared on 'Savvatiano', 'Agiorgitiko' and 'Merlot'. However, mortality and developmental rates, mean lifetime fecundity and population growth parameters didn't differ significantly among grapevine cultivars. Overall, our data showed that all examined cultivars are suitable hosts for the aphid.

Recent studies have indicated that the pest is spreading to new locations where it was not reported before. In the current study, laboratory investigations were carried out to determine the combined effect of different levels of relative humidity and temperature regimes on the development and fecundity of C. partellus, as these physical factors are known to play an important role in the life cycle of insects and adaptability to local climate. Developmental time, longevity, potential fecundity and realized fecundity of C. partellus were measured under controlled conditions. Three temperature regimes (22 degrees C, 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and three relative humidity levels (40%, 60% and 80%) were tested. It was found that temperature, relative humidity (RH) and their interaction significantly affected the developmental time, adult longevity, potential fecundity and realized fecundity of the pest. Developmental time was inversely related to temperature. Mean duration of C. partellus life cycle was 70.2 days at 22 degrees C and 80% RH, whereas it took only 26.5 days to complete its life cycle at 30 degrees C and 40% RH. Male and female longevity were similar in most cases. The adult life span ranged between 6.9-11.1 days at 22 degrees C and 3.1-7.2 days at 30 degrees C for different levels of relative humidity.

We evaluated number of instars, duration of each instar and the nymphal period, survival of instars, duration of the reproductive period, daily and total production of nymphs, and longevity of the nymphal and adult phases. To construct the life expectancy table and fecundity, daily observations were made of 70 nymphs at each temperature, from birth to death. Development of R. path was faster with increased temperature, but they did not complete the last nymphal instar at 32 degrees C. The same pattern occurred for the pre-reproductive, reproductive, and post-reproductive periods. The highest fecundity rates were between 16 degrees C and 24 degrees C. The highest fertility (4 nymphs/female/day) was recorded at 12 degrees C and 20 degrees C. The highest net reproduction rates were at 24 degrees C and 28 degrees C, and the time interval between each generation (T) and the population doubling time (DT) diminished as temperature increased. The finite rate of increase (lambda = 1.9 nymphs/female/day) and the intrinsic rate-of increase (r(m) = 0.64) were greatest at 24 degrees C and 28 degrees C, respectively. There was a negative impact on the biology and life table of R. padi at 32 degrees C, but the range of 12 degrees C to 28 degrees C, despite some fluctuations, was favorable for survival and reproduction.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,28,0.64,no,Euler-Lotka,,36,n hembras ,Hemiptera,Aphididae,Rhopalosiphum,padi,sucker,signal grass,Poaceae,signal grass,Poaceae,70,yes,8,Hamedan (Iran),34.79833,48.51485,,10.1653/024.092.0406,FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0015-4040,1938-5102,2009,,WOS:000273108500006

S. and Mexico and that is currently the object of an eradication/control program in both countries. One tactic used to mitigate the threat of this species involves the SIT (Sterile Insect Technique), in which large numbers of larvae are reared on artificial diet or cactus cladodes, preferably the former, and released as sterile adults to mate with wild individuals at or near the leading edge of invasion. We studied combinations of 3 different rearing temperatures (22, 26, and 29 degrees C) and 3 different crowding levels (50, 215, and 500 eggs) to determine percent survival to the adult stage, pupal size of each gender, and fecundity of C. cactorum reared on a factitious meridic diet. Temperature and crowding levels affected survival. The lowest rearing temperature and the low and high crowding levels adversely affect survival. Female pupae were larger than male pupae, and pupal size of males, but not females, was affected by rearing temperature, with smaller male pupae produced at the lowest temperature. Length and width, but not weight, of female pupae were affected by crowding levels, with slightly larger pupae produced at the intermediate level. For both genders, there was significant regression of pupal weight on percent survival, with larger pupae produced from treatment combinations that produced higher percent survival to the adult stage.

However, this mite has been found infesting Cabrales cheese in Spain, though its population density is low compared to Acarus farris, the prevalent species of astigmatid mite encountered in Cabrales cheese maturing caves. One of the factors that might be influencing this differential abundance is temperature. In the present study the effect of temperature on reproductive parameters and longevity of T. neiswanderi was examined at six constant temperatures, ranging from 10 to 31 degrees C, and a relative humidity of 90 +/- 5%. Preoviposition period, fecundity and daily fecundity were adversely affected by extreme temperatures while the oviposition period increased as temperature was reduced. Male and female longevity increased as temperature decreased, but males showed significantly greater longevity than females. Additionally, this difference was greater as temperature decreased. The effect of temperature on the intrinsic rate of natural increase of T. neiswanderi populations was described by the non-linear Lactin model. The optimum temperature for development was predicted at 26.6 degrees C. At this temperature, the population doubling time is 2.8 days. The lower and upper thresholds for T. neiswanderi populations were calculated at 7.4 and 31.7 degrees C, respectively. According to these results, the influence of temperature on the low population density of this mite found in Cabrales maturing caves compared with A. farris is discussed.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,,,no (Cabrales),10.1007/s10493-007-9118-6,EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0168-8162,NA,2007,,WOS:000250922200006

Laboratory life history studies were conducted at 18, 22, 26, 30, and 34 degrees C to understand cactus moth biology and to develop strategies for control. Duration of immature stages was generally longest at 18 degrees C, declining significantly at 22 degrees C, and shortest at 26, 30, and 34 degrees C. Total immature developmental time from eggs to pupae was approximate to 180 d at 18 degrees C, 116 at 22 degrees C, and ranged from 65 to 72 d at 26-34 degrees C. Developmental rate for egg-to-pupal stages was estimated using the logistic equation, rate = 0.0165/(1 + (T/20.7093)(-5-8823)). Percentage survival of immatures was usually lowest at the temperature extremes tested (18 and 34 degrees C), but they did not differ between the sexes. Estimated lower developmental threshold temperature was 13.3 degrees C, resulting in estimated degree-days for development from approximate to 845 at 18 degrees C to 1,387 at 34 degrees C. In general, pupal weights declined with increasing temperature, and they were always lower in males than in females. Female adult survivorship was longest at 18 degrees C, and shortest at 34 degrees C, with the other treatments clustered between the temperature extremes. The highest reproductive values were found at 30 degrees C, which indicates an approximate optimal temperature. Net reproductive rate (R,), gross reproductive rate (GRR), generation time (T), intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (A), and doubling time (DT) were 43.68 female/female, 44.02 female/female, 67.14 d, 0.0562 female/female/d, 1.058 female/female/d, and 12.33 d, respectively. An oviposition rate surface describing mean oviposition rate as a function of time and temperature was, eggs = (-11.241 + 0.854T) d exp (-0.020Td).

Moench] revealed that the developmental time of the nymphal stages averaged 6.9 d when reared on O.sativa and 10.7 d when reared on Z. mays. Comparison of the nitrogen content of the three host plants indicated that the root nitrogen content was highest in O. sativa. The effect of nitrogen content on aphid performance, however, is still not clear.

Italia","The mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) constitutes one of the main pest of grape crop at the Submedio Sao Francisco Valley. The objective of this work was to study the biology of the broad mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks), to determine its thermal requirements and its fertility life table in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cv. Italy. Acclimatized chambers (BOD) were used, adjusted to the temperatures of 18, 22, 25, 28 and 32 degrees C, relative humidity of 65 +/- 10% and alternated light of 12h. Egg-adult period was 3.4 and 6.8 days for males and 3.5 and 7.4 days for females, respectively at 32 degrees C and 18 degrees C. At the temperatures of 18, 25 and 32 degrees C, each female deposited, respectively, 16.5, 44.3 and 13.3 eggs. The stages of egg, larva and pupa and egg-adult period presented, respectively, thermal thresholds of 11.23, 9.45, 12.19, and 9.71 degrees C and thermal constant of 28.51, 14.59, 8.33, and 62.73 degrees-day. The mean duration of one generation (T) was 25.6, 10.8 and 8.2 days, respectively, at the temperatures of 18, 25 and 32 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-0) at the temperature of 25 degrees C was the highest, corresponding to an increase of 30.12 times at each generation. The intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) was 0.10 (18 degrees C), 0.31 (25 degrees C) and 0.12 (32 degrees C) and the finite ratio of population increase (lambda) was 1.10 (18 degrees C), 1.36 (25 degrees C) and 1.13 (32 degrees C).

Knowledge of the temperature-dependent population growth potential is crucial for understanding population dynamics and implementing pest control strategies in different agro-ecological zones. The development, mortality of immature life stages, and reproduction of P. operculella were studied at constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32degreesC. The theoretical developmental thresholds were 11, 13.5, and 11.8degreesC, and required incubation times were 65.3,165.1, and 107.6 degree-days (DD) for the egg, larval, and pupal stages, respectively. The nonlinear shape of the temperature-development curve at low temperatures was well described by the modified four-parameter Sharpe & DeMichele model. The log-normal function was fitted to the normalized cumulative frequency distributions of developmental times for each life stage. Temperature effects on immature mortality were described by polynomial regressions. The optimal temperature for survival was within the range of 20-30degreesC. Temperature effects on adult senescence were described by the modified Sharpe & DeMichele model. A polynomial function was fitted to total fecundity and temperature. Fecundity was highest around 21degreesC. Age-related cumulative proportions of fecundity were well described by a Gamma function. Most eggs were laid within the first quarter of the female life span. The established functions were used to build a P. operculella population model, and life table parameters were simulated over a range of temperatures. Calculations gave good predictions when compared with published data.

S,1,"Burgess, AJ; Warrington, S; Allen-Williams, L",Cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae L.) 'performance' on oilseed rape (Brassica napus. L.) experiencing water deficits: Roles of temperature and food quality.,"It has been suggested that plants experiencing water deficits offer a higher quality source of nutrition to feeding insects. This hypothesis was investigated by assessing the performance of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), an important pest on Crucifers, on the crop plant oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Aphid growth and reproduction was measured at three controlled air temperatures and four watering regimes to induce water deficits. Plant nutritional quality (soluble nitrogen) and microclimate (leaf temperature), both important for aphid growth and reproduction, were determined. With increasing water deficit both soluble nitrogen content (% dry weight) and leaf temperature (degrees C) increased. At all three temperatures development time of the aphid to reproductive age was faster with increasing plant water deficits. Mean relative growth rates and the intrinsic rate of natural increase significantly increased with increasing water deficit at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, and 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees C respectively. Air temperature, leaf temperature, and soluble nitrogen are important factors on aphid growth and reproduction. The results indicate that during periods of water deficit of oilseed rape plants, aspects of the growth and reproduction of B.brassicae are increased which may result in a faster rate of increase of aphid populations on this crop.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,15,0.29,no,Wyatt-white,,9,n adultos,Hemiptera,Aphididae,Brevicoryne,brassicae,sucker,oilseed rape,Brassicaceae,oilseed rape,Brassicaceae,high,yes,16,Hertfordshire (UK),51.84005,-0.09786,,10.17660/ActaHortic.1996.407.63,INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BRASSICAS: NINTH CRUCIFER GENETICS WORKSHOP,NA,NA,ISHS Symposium on Brassicas/9th Crucifer Genetics Workshop,"NOV 15-19, 1994","LISBON, PORTUGAL","Int Soc Hort Sci, Commiss European Union, Portuguese Hort Assoc",NA,NA,NA,NA,0567-7572,NA,1996,,WOS:000071638600063

About 50% of females were fecund. The laboratory temperatures at which adults were reared (15, 20, and 25 degrees C) had no significant effect on fecundity (62.3 eggs per female) but influenced longevity; adults at 15 degrees C lived longer than at 20 or 25 degrees C. The mean preovipositional and ovipositional periods were 31.5 and 49.0 days, respectively. Less than 1% of adult weevils released in the field survived the winter; overwintering, adults lived 10 months. Egg eclosion occurred 16 days after oviposition with 78% of the eggs viable.

J,1,"VANRIJN, PCJ; MOLLEMA, C; STEENHUISBROERS, GM","COMPARATIVE LIFE-HISTORY STUDIES OF FRANKLINIELLA-OCCIDENTALIS AND THRIPS TABACI (THYSANOPTERA, THRIPIDAE) ON CUCUMBER","Shortly after its invasion into Europe, the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), became a more severe pest of greenhouse crops than the onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman. To test whether this differential pest status was due to a larger capacity of population increase, a comparative life history study was carried out on cucumber (Cucumis sativus cv. Corona). Experiments at 25 degrees C showed that the egg-to-egg period of F. occidentalis was shorter, but its peak ovipositional rate was lower and its offspring sex ratio more male biased. These differences resulted in a slightly lower intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) for F. occidentalis than for T. tabaci (0.166 vs. 0.176/day). It was shown experimentally that between 15 and 28 degrees C, developmental rate of F. occidentalis is linearly related to temperature, with a theoretical threshold temperature similar to the value reported for T. tabaci (10.9 vs. 11.5 degrees C). It is argued that the r(m)-value of F. occidentalis will not be higher than that of T. tabaci for any temperature within this range.
