J,"Pathak, TB; Maskey, ML; Rijal, JP","Impact of climate change on navel orangeworm, amajor pest of tree nuts in California","California's agricultural sector is the highest valued agricultural sector in the United States. It is also a global leader in the production of various specialty crops, including three major tree nuts - almond, walnut, and pistachio. These three nut crops accounted for approximately 16% of the state's total agricultural economy. Current and future changes in climate posemany challenges in agriculture and impacts related to increased pest pressure in agriculture due to elevated temperatures are significant. The navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker), is the most challenging pest of tree nuts in California and often cause a significant economic loss despite the careful implementation of multiple pest control tactics. Temperature variations can directly affect the developmental rates, behavior, and overall population dynamics of this pest, and it is critically important to understand these dynamics with respect to climate change. The objective of this study was to quantify changes in the timing and number of navel orange worm generations in almonds, walnuts, and pistachios for the entire Central Valley of California using projections from ten general circulation models (GCMs) under two emission scenarios. The results suggest that navel orangeworm is likely to complete its life cycle much faster under climate change due to projected temperature increases. The results also suggest that under future climate change, navel orangeworm can complete one additional generation within the growing season and likely going to pose significant risks to these major nut industries in the future. Quantifying navel orangeworm generations and assessing risks to tree nuts under climate change can help facilitate and strategize integrated pest management (IPM) practices to the sustainability of the production systems by minimizing risks.

Utilizing native predatory natural enemies is one of the useful biological control strategies to maintain pest population below the level where damage occurs for an extended period of time. Although a handful of pesticides and predatory natural enemy species have proven effective on the integrated control of the citrus red mite, they are not hard-hitting tactics for control of the P. citri eggs due to the protection of egg-shell. This study evaluated the potential of a native species of philic egg-consumption predatory thrips, Scolothrips takahashii, for control of P. citri in southwestern Chinese citrus orchards. An age-stage, two sex life table of S. takahashii was constructed, showing this predatory thrips could develop and reproduce successfully when fed on all stages of P. citri. All the functional responses of S. takahashii adult males and females on different stages of P. citri fit the Holling II disc equation, whereas this predatory thrips preferred eggs of P. citri significantly more than their larvae or nymph. Mutual interference results indicated that the searching efficiency and predation rate of S. takahashii decreased significantly with increased predator densities when supplied with sufficient P. citri eggs. Overall, this study indicated the potential of S. takahashii as a biological control agent of P. citri and helped to characterize the role of native predatory thrips in pest mite management.",no,,,,,CROP PROTECTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0261-2194,1873-6904,2021,10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105421,WOS:000600888500002

Since 2013, SI has killed more than 30,000 sweetgum trees in Shanghai and adjacent areas. In Shanghai, SI was observed to emerge from infested wood between April-September and exhibited two generations per year. Both the flying populations and those in colonized logs were female-biased. After the parental adult initiates a gallery, the emergence of new adults required 73.4 +/- 0.7 days at 30 degrees C and 163.5 +/- 0.9 days at 20 degrees C. SI could not sustain population development at constant temperatures <= 15 degrees C. The fungi Geosmithia spp. and Phaeoacremonium tuscanum were common associates of SI. The results suggest that SI has a long flight period, and its development is sensitive to low temperatures. Fungi associated with SI were not pathogenic to American sweetgum trees, but their presence may indirectly increase the probability of tree mortality.

The species has recently been expanding its range to the main islands of Japan, where it had previously not been distributed. In this study, the life-history traits of a local population in southern Kyushu, Japan were examined. The adults showed a long-day photoperiodic response at 20 and 25 degrees C with critical photophases of 13.97 and 12.52 h/day, respectively: female adults reared under long-day conditions laid eggs, whereas those reared under short-day conditions did not and entered diapause. When adults that had been reared under 16L-8D at 20 degrees C were transferred to 12L-12D at 20 degrees C, they ceased laying eggs. These results, together with the developmental threshold temperature and thermal constant obtained for each stage, suggest that the beetle overwinters in the adult stage in a state of diapause and produces a maximum of three generations per year in southern Kyushu.",no,,,,,APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0003-6862,1347-605X,2021,10.1007/s13355-020-00716-4,WOS:000607013500001

The most effective management option for controlling Hessian fly is the use of resistant wheat cultivars carrying specific resistance genes. However, wheat resistance genes to Hessian fly are affected by temperature. Two Moroccan cultivars 'Chaoui' and 'Marouane' and three ICARDA elites DWHF01, DWHF02 and Icamoram7 all carrying resistance to Moroccan Hessian fly populations were evaluated at three different temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). Results showed that the elite DWHF01 and DWHF02 resistance was less affected by higher temperatures with percentage of resistant plants remaining above 60% at 30 degrees C. However, 'Marouane', 'Icamoram7' and 'Chaoui' lost more than 50% of their resistance at 30 degrees C. Resistance in all these genotypes was expressed only as antibiosis with presence of dead first instars on resistant plants. The number of live larvae on susceptible plants was counted and larval density decreased with increasing temperature. Moreover, length measurements of live larvae showed significant differences across different temperatures, the size of larvae increased as temperature increased and ranged between 3.23 and 4.13 mm.

The insecticides viz., diamides (flubendiamide), avermectins (emamectin benzoate), organophosphates (quinalphos), spinosyns (spinosad) and synthetic pyrethroids (deltamethrin) were tested for their efficacy and persistence toxicity (PT) at eTemp and eCO(2). The twelve set conditions comprising of reference (28 +/- 0.5 degrees C; 380 ppm), eTemp (29, 30, 31, 32, 34 +/- 0.5 C-o with 380 ppm CO2), eCO(2) (28 +/- 0.5 C-o; 550 ppm) and eTemp+eCO(2) (29, 30, 31, 32, 34 +/- 0.5 (o)c with 550 ppm CO2) were maintained in CTGC. Interactive effects of eCO(2) and eTemp caused the higher LC50 values of spinosad and deltamethrin with negative temperature coefficients and showed the 'reduction of toxicity'. Lower LC50 values and positive temperature coefficients for flubendiamide (6.67), emamectin benzoate (7.38) and quinalphos (3.04) were recorded, indicating the 'higher toxicity' at interactive eCO(2) and eTemp. The order in PT of insecticides was deltamethrineTemp + eCO(2) conditions over reference.

Recently in India, whitefly threat is increasing in cotton crop. North Indian cotton growing belt experienced severe outbreak of this pests during 2014-15 causing huge yield losses. With the changing climate scenario and the polyphagous trait of B. tabaci, its infestation may quickly spread over other regions of the world. In the present study, a temperature-based phenology model is developed for B. tabaci by rearing it on cotton leaves under laboratory conditions (growth chamber) at six constant temperatures (15-37 degrees C). The developmental rates and survivorship of immature life stages and reproductive parameters of adult life stages of B. tabaci were estimated by fitting various non-linear mathematical equations to the temperature-dependent development data obtained in laboratory. A cohort updating and rate summation approach was employed in stochastic simulation of life table parameters at different test temperatures. The study revealed that development time decreased with increase in temperature within the evaluation range of temperatures. The life cycle of B. tabaci was shortest at 32 degrees C with the shortest mean development time (30 days) and the longest development time (63 days) was obtained at 17 degrees C. The optimum developmental temperatures predicted for various immature life stages of B. tabaci were: 20.4, 18.03, 26.83, 26.83 and 22.93 degrees C for egg, nymph1, nymph2, nymph3 and pseudopupa, respectively. Wang model fits well to estimate temperature-dependent mortality of B. tabaci life stages. The mortality was lower at 32 degrees C and higher at 37 degrees C.

The aims of this study are to investigate the primary weather conditions that might influence forest defoliation and to identify the most important life stage of the larch caterpillar at which forest defoliation might be mitigated by incorporating more inhibitory influences from climatic factors. The life cycle of the larch caterpillar was partitioned into four stages and multiple linear regression and mixed effect models were combined with a relative weight analysis approach to evaluate the importance and influence of meteorological variables on defoliation dynamics. The results show that warmer temperatures in growing seasons and overwintering periods can increase the defoliation area, while rainy and humid growing seasons decrease the defoliation area. Total precipitation during the early instar larval period had the greatest power to explain the variance in defoliation dynamics and had a very strong inhibitory effect, followed by the accumulative temperatures of the late instar larval period which had a positive impact, and precipitation during the middle instar larval period which had a negative impact. Weather conditions during the early instar larval period had the greatest influence on the area defoliated and accounted for 40% of the explained variance.

Elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and temperature (eT) affect agricultural crops as well as pests and their natural enemies. Changes in any part of multitrophic systems due to environmental factors can affect pest infestation and disease dynamics, as well as the effectiveness of biological control programs. Our study evaluated the effects of eCO(2) and eT combined on the performance of the parasitoid Aphidius colemani Vierick (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) when its aphid host Rhopalosiphum padi L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was exposed to non-infected or Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV) infected wheat (Triticum aestivum L., Poaceae). Using controlled environment chambers, plant physiology and parasitoid performance were examined under ambient (aCO(2)& aT; aCO(2) = 400 ppm, aT = 20 degrees C) and elevated (eCO(2)& eT; eCO(2) = 800 ppm, eT = 22 degrees C) conditions. Virus infection reduced plant biomass and chlorophyll content more pronouncedly under eCO(2)&eT. Developmental time from oviposition to adult emergence of A. colemani significantly decreased under eCO(2)&eT, on virus-infected and non-infected plants. However, parasitism rate, sex ratio and pupal survivorship remained unchanged under eCO(2)&eT, regardless of virus infection. Therefore, we incline to suggest that the biocontrol of R. padi by A. colemani will continue being effective in a future climate with similar conditions as studied here.

In this study, we employed Maximum Entropy (Maxent) to develop a bioclimate-based species distribution model (SDM) for the parasitoid from presence-only data recorded from field surveys conducted in select points the Philippines. Results of assessment of the generated model point to its excellent power in predicting either suitability of habitat, or potential occurrence or distribution of C. calauanica. Since the parasitoid is highly host-specific, the model may also apply to A. rigidus. Field surveys in select areas in the Philippines confirmed the occurrence of the invasive coconut scale in areas predicted by the model as having considerable probability of occurrence, or habitat suitability. Our findings strongly suggest the potential utility of Maxent SDMs as tools for pest invasion forecasting and GIS-aided surveillance for integrated pest management (IPM). Comperiella calauanica is a host-specific endoparasitoid and effective biological control agent of the diaspidid Aspidiotus rigidus, whose outbreak from 2010 to 2015 severely threatened the coconut industry in the Philippines. Using the maximum entropy (Maxent) algorithm, we developed a species distribution model (SDM) for C. calauanica based on 19 bioclimatic variables, using occurrence data obtained mostly from field surveys conducted in A. rigidus-infested areas in Luzon Island from 2014 to 2016. The calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for the model were very high (0.966, standard deviation = 0.005), indicating the model's high predictive power. Precipitation seasonality was found to have the highest relative contribution to model development. Response curves produced by Maxent suggested the positive influence of mean temperature of the driest quarter, and negative influence of precipitation of the driest and coldest quarters on habitat suitability. Given that C. calauanica has been found to always occur with A. rigidus in Luzon Island due to high host-specificity, the SDM for the parasitoid may also be considered and used as a predictive model for its host. This was confirmed through field surveys conducted between late 2016 and early 2018, which found and confirmed the occurrence of A. rigidus in three areas predicted by the SDM to have moderate to high habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of C. calauanica: Zamboanga City in Mindanao; Isabela City in Basilan Island; and Tablas Island in Romblon. This validation in the field demonstrated the utility of the bioclimate-based SDM for C. calauanica in predicting habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of A. rigidus in the Philippines.",no,,,,,INSECTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,2075-4450,2021,10.3390/insects12010026,WOS:000610284600001

Halyomporpha halys overwinters in anthropogenic structures as an adult. We investigated seasonal variation in the cold tolerance, water balance, and energetics of H. halys in southwestern Ontario. We also induced diapause in laboratory-reared animals with short daylength at permissive temperatures and compared cold tolerance, water balance, energetics, and metabolism and gas exchange between diapausing and non-diapausing individuals. Halyomorpha halys that overwintered outside in Ontario all died, but most of those that overwintered in sheltered habitats survived. We confirm that overwintering H. halys are chill-susceptible. Over winter, Ontario H. halys depressed their supercooling point to c. -15.4 degrees C, and 50% survived a 1 h exposure to -17.5 degrees C. They reduce water loss rates over winter, and do not appear to significantly consume lipid or carbohydrate reserves to a level that might cause starvation. Overall, it appears that H. halys is dependent on built structures and other buffered microhabitats to successfully overwinter in Ontario. Laboratory-reared diapausing H. halys have lower supercooling points than their non-diapausing counterparts, but LT50 is not enhanced by diapause induction. Diapausing H. halys survive desiccating conditions for 3-4 times longer than those not in diapause, through decreases in both respiratory and cuticular water loss.

J,"Smit, C; Javal, M; Lehmann, P; Terblanche, JS",Metabolic responses to starvation and feeding contribute to the invasiveness of an emerging pest insect,"Metabolic rate, and the flexibility thereof, is a complex trait involving several inter-linked variables that can influence animal energetics, behavior, and ultimately, fitness. Metabolic traits respond readily to ambient temperature variation, in some cases increasing relative or absolute energetic costs, while in other cases, depending on the organism's metabolic and behavioral responses to changing conditions, resulting in substantial energy savings. To gain insight into the rapid recent emergence of the indigenous South African longhorn beetle Cacosceles newmannii as a crop pest in sugarcane, a better understanding of its metabolic rate, feeding response, digestion times, and aerobic scope is required, in conjunction with any behavioral responses to food availability or limitation thereof. Here, we therefore experimentally determined metabolic rate, estimated indirectly as CO2 production using flow-through respirometry, in starved, fasted, and fed C. newmannii larvae, at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. We estimated multiple parameters of metabolic rate (starved, standard, active, and maximum metabolic rates) as well as aerobic scope (AS), specific dynamic action (SDA), and the percentage time active during respirometry trials. Additionally, in individuals that showed cyclic or discontinuous gas exchange patterns, we compared rate, volume, and duration of cycles, and how these were influenced by temperature. Standard and active metabolic rate, and AS and SDA were significantly higher in the larvae measured at 30 degrees C than those measured at 20 degrees C. By contrast, starved and maximum metabolic rates and percentage time active were unaffected by temperature. At rest and after digestion was complete, 35% of larvae showed cyclic gas exchange at both temperatures; 5% and 15% showed continuous gas exchange at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C respectively, and 10% and 0% showed discontinuous gas exchange at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C respectively. We propose that the ability of C. newmannii larvae to survive extended periods of resource limitation, combined with a rapid ability to process food upon securing resources, even at cooler conditions that would normally suppress digestion in tropical insects, may have contributed to their ability to feed on diverse low energy resources typical of their host plants, and become pests of, and thrive on, a high energy host plant like sugarcane.",yes,experimental,laboratory,metabolism,,JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-1910,1879-1611,2021,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2020.104162,WOS:000605762300002

Results indicated that the foraging activity increased after sunrise, and maximum foraging occurred at 14:00 (foraging rate was 69.22 +/- 0.57 and 72.58 +/- 1.15 foragers/min in the first and second year, respectively) in the tea fields of Guangzhou during autumn. Furthermore, foragers demonstrated circadian rhythms and exhibited a unimodal after 24 h. A significant correlation was found between foraging activity and temperature. S. invicta colonies were active at moderate soil temperatures (approximately 26.65 degrees C to 29.24 degrees C). The preferred temperature of the colonies was 26 degrees C, followed by 22 degrees C and 18 degrees C in the laboratory. The individual S. invicta activity was maximum at 17:00 (18.67 +/- 1.66 times/10 min) and minimum at 5:00 (8.33 +/- 2.51 times/10 min) at 26 degrees C. The fluctuating temperature had a significant impact on individual locomotor activity (r = 0.8979, P < 0.01) but did not alter the rhythm activity. Our results demonstrated that temperature might play an important role in circadian foraging rhythms activity of S. invicta.

Temperature is one the most important factors affecting their efficacy as biological control agents (BCAs) and a better understanding of temperature effects can help to select the best performing species for certain climatic conditions. In this study we assessed the thermal requirements of six dicyphine species: Dicyphus bolivari (2 different strains), Dicyphus eckerleini, Dicyphus errans, Dicyphus flavoviridis, Nesidiocoris tenuis and Macrolophus pygmaeus. Two experimental methods were used: one static, by recording the developmental times at six temperatures (15-40 degrees C) and one dynamic, by determining low and high temperature thresholds for movement. Based on the results of both methods we identified two groups: N. tenuis, M. pygmaeus and D. bolivari showed the best performance at high temperatures and the species D. errans, D. eckerleini and D. flavoviridis were most active at low temperatures. Dicyphus bolivari and N. tenuis were the only species able to reach adulthood at the constant temperature of 35 degrees C. At low temperatures, D. eckerleini and D. errans were the only species still able to walk below 0 degrees C.

Using the small-scale survey data collected in 2017 from farm households in Tatopani rural municipality of Jumla district, the study found that a majority of households perceived changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, timing of seasons, incidence of drought and water availability, compared with the situation 10 years ago (2007 or earlier). They perceived mixed impacts of climate change on the production of major crops: a decline in the production of brown rice, wheat and barley, and an increase in the production of potato and local beans. Food security analysis showed that farm households had low dietary diversity, and 42% of them were food insecure. Regression analysis found that perceived climate-induced changes in water availability, timing of seasons, incidence of hazards and incidence of crop pest attacks had negative relationship with household food security.

A MaxEnt species distributions model (SDM) was developed based on collected FAW occurrence and environmental data's. Bioclimatic zones were identified and the potential distribution of FAW in South Kivu, eastern DR Congo, was predicted. Results Mean annual temperature (bio1), annual rainfall (bio12), temperature seasonality (bio4) and longest dry season duration (llds) mainly affected the FAW potential distribution. The average area under the curve value of the model was 0.827 demonstrating the model efficient accuracy. According to Jackknife test of variable importance, the annual rainfall was found to correspond to the highest gain when used in isolation. FAWs' suitable areas where this pest is likely to be present in South Kivu province are divided into two corridors. The Eastern corridor covering the Eastern areas of Kalehe, Kabare, Walungu, Uvira and Fizi territories and the Western corridor covering the Western areas of Kalehe, Kabare, Walungu and Mwenga. Conclusions This research provides important information on the distribution of FAW and bioclimatic zones in South Kivu.

We studied effects of environmental factors on the distribution of the fall armyworm and its host (maize) plant growth in the tropical mountainous area of Huize County, province of Yunnan, southwest China. Moreover, the relationships among the FAW distribution, environmental factors (altitude, temperature and humidity) and plant growth (mean kernel weight, kernel number per ear and ear weight) were analysed. The results showed that FAW predominated at altitude 1,243.3 m, temperature 21.4 degrees C and humidity 82.1%. The host plant grew best at 1,200-1,312 m, 21.0-21.7 degrees C and 81.2%-82.0%. Environmental factors indirectly influenced the distribution of FAW via the host plant growth. Compared with environmental factors, the host plant growth had a simplistic positive linear relationship with the density of FAW. FAW is less impacted by abiotic factors rather it determined by host plant prevalence, and thus the locations where maize plants grow best are preferred by FAW and should be the focus of insecticide applications.

Surveys frequently target new arrivals to mitigate establishment. Alternatively, monitoring pest activity in exporting countries can inform arrival and establishment risk. Methods: We report >3 years data from daily sampling of bark- and wood-boring insects that are associated with recently felled Pinus radiata D.Don at five New Zealand ports. Results: Average catch differed between ports and months with Arhopalus ferus (Mulsant), Hylurgus ligniperda F., and Hylastes ater (Paykull) comprising 99.6% of the total catch. Arhopalus ferus was absent during winter with Hylastes ater and Hyturgus ligniperda activity between June and August representing 3.5 and 3.7% of total catch, respectively. Maximum temperature and wind speed influenced flight activity of all three species but not universally across all ports. Flight activity transitioned to a nonlinear pattern above 20 degrees C. Arhopalus ferus has a unimodal flight risk period between late-September and late-April. Hylastes ater was also unimodal except in Dunedin where it was bimodal like Hylurgus ligniperda was in all regions with spring and mid- to late-summer activity periods. Although Hylastes ater was observed during winter, the probability of a flight event during winter was between 0 and 0.02 per week. Hylurgus ligniperda flight probability was zero in Dunedin and low at all other ports from May to August. Conclusions: Modelling seasonal changes in flight probability can inform risk-based phytosanitary measures.

Despite the severe economic impact caused by this pest in its native and invaded range, information on its potential range expansion under changing climate remains largely unknown. In this study, we employed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach to predict the global potential climatic suitability of B. zonata under current climate and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for the year 2050. Outputs from MaxEnt were merged with Spatial Production Allocation Model. A natural dispersal model using Gaussian dispersal kernel was developed. The Areas Under Curves generated by MaxEnt were greater than 0.92 for both current and future climate change scenarios, indicating satisfactory performances of the models. Mean temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation of driest month and temperature seasonality significantly influenced the potential establishment of B. zonata. The models indicated high climatic suitability in tropical and subtropical areas in Asia and Africa, where the species has already been recorded. Suitable areas were predicted in West, East and Central Africa and to a lesser extent in Central and South America. Future climatic scenarios models, RCP 4.5 and 8.5 show significant potential range expansion of B. zonata in Western Sahara, while RCP 4.5 highlighted expansion in Southern Africa. Contrarily, RCP 2.6 showed considerable decrease in B. zonata range expansion in Central, East and West Africa. There was increased climatic suitability of B. zonata in Egypt and Middle East under RCP 6.0.

The need for such assessments to occur in conjunction with maintenance of environmental water temperatures has also been emphasized. When the costs of departures from natural thermal regimes are considered, this moves from being an academic exercise to a tangible management imperative. Pest outbreaks of aquatic macroinvertebrates typically occur when environmental conditions disproportionately and overwhelmingly favor a particular species. This has been the case for at least three major river systems of economic importance in South Africa, namely, the Orange River and its major tributary (Vaal River) as well as the Great Fish River. In these rivers, two species of pest blackfly, Simulium chutteri and S. damnosum (Diptera: Simuliidae), have become problematic following on from changes in natural flows through either impoundment or interbasin transfers. In this study, a statistically robust reference thermal condition was defined and exceedances assessed (based on a 2 degrees C increase in water temperatures). The implications of these assessments were then applied to future possible pest blackfly outbreaks, factoring in changes in flows in response to global climate change. Results show that the current seasonal variation in the likelihood of pest outbreaks is replaced by high perpetual outbreak probabilities. Interactions between major environmental variables become synergistic, with major cost implications to regional economies. Lessons from this study can be generalized and used as a means of predicting similar synergistic effects in other aquatic macroinvertebrate disease vectors (such as bilharzia vector snails and mosquitoes) in response to global climate change.",no,,,,,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1535-1459,1535-1467,NA,10.1002/rra.3757,WOS:000596606900001

Data were analyzed using the descriptive and inferential statistics were used together with the logit regression model. Climate change over the last three decades was found to have a negative impact the food security status of households. Crop production was constrained by poor rainfall, severe erosion, and increases in temperature. The unpredictability of rainfall, pests, and diseases were also contributing factors. Using the calorie intake approach, 60.5% of sampled respondents were found to be food insecure. Analysis using the logistic regression model showed that age and family size, as well as the amount of cultivated land and rainfall, were the significant (p < .05) factors influencing household food security status. A large proportion (69.8%) of farmers were incorporating adapting strategies into farm management including improved use of crop varieties and livestock production, in addition to income diversification.

Predators are important in regulating rodent populations, and determining how to maximise the role of predators in the comprehensive management of rodent pests is one of the most important issues in rodent control. To accurately understand the activities and vegetation damage patterns of the great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) in a desert forest area, as well as the activities of its predators, we set up infrared cameras in the Sal Hu Song desert forest region of Altay city, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, in December 2016 and conducted one year of field monitoring of R. opimus and its predators. A total of 2407 independent and valid photographs of R. opimus and its predators were collected. By calculating the relative abundance index, we analysed the activity rhythms of R. opimus and its predators and calculated the correlations of their activity rhythms. The relative abundance of R. opimus was 237.75 in Sal Hu Song, and the predators were mainly the long-legged buzzard (Buteo rufinus) at 94.50, marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna) at 45.74, and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) at 44.26. R. opimus is a typical diurnal animal, with activity peaks occurring between 10:00 and 12:00 and between 17:00 and 19:00, and its activities were mainly movement and foraging. Over the year, R. opimus had two peak activity periods, March and September-October. The peak activity periods of V. peregusna were March and September, while the peak activity period of V. vulpes was February-March. The peak activity period of B. rufinus was June. Among these three predators, the activity rhythms of V. peregusna had the highest correlation with those of R. opimus.

Such exposure leads insects toa reversible comatose state termed chill-coma, but the consequences of this state for the organism biology were little explored. Here, the consequences of the chill-coma phase were investigated in two of the main stored product pest species - the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (larvae and adults) and the rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae (adults). For this purpose, a series of low-temperature shocks were used to estimate the chill-coma recovery time (CCRT), survival, nutrition and weight gain/growth of T. castaneum (larvae and adults) and S. oryzae, as well as the development of T. castaneum life stages. The relatively long CCRT was characteristic of beetle larvae, at different low-temperature shocks, and CCRT increased with decreasing temperatures and increasing exposure intervals for both pest species. The survival was little affected by the low-temperature shocks applied, but such shocks affected insect feeding and growth. Tribolium castaneum larvae was more sensitive than adults of both insect species. Moreover, the relative consumption and weight gain of S. oryzae adults were lower than those of T. castaneum adults and mainly larvae, while feeding deterrence was not affected by low temperature shocks, unlike food conversion efficiency. Low-temperature shocks, even under short duration at some temperatures, significantly delayed development. The lower the temperature and the higher the exposure period, the more delayed the development.

In this study, we aimed to predict the global potential distribution of T. castaneum under the current climate and in response to climate change (2050 and 2100). In addition, we attempted to use the results for estimating damage and economic losses in the major cocoa beans-producing countries. The CLIMEX model was used to evaluate the climatic suitability of regions for T. castaneum, and the economic damage was estimated by incorporating a series of published models and published data. The results showed that the potential distribution of T. castaneum was consistent with that of cocoa beans-producing countries, and as expected, at the local-level, T. castaneum was concentrated in cocoa cultivation areas. It was estimated that up to 50% damage to cocoa beans and economic loss of 3.16 billion US dollars due to production loss could occur. This study is the first attempt to estimate the economic damage to cocoa bean production by predicting the potential distribution of T. castaneum. Further, this study not only provides insight to combine the potential distribution of a species and an estimation of the related economics, but also provides basic data for establishing an effective monitoring/controlling strategy for preventing damage by T. castaneum.

The adults were exposed to the studied factors on concrete arenas prepared in plastic Petri dishes. Twenty up to 24 h old adults were released in each Petri dish, and their mortality was recorded 72 h after treatment. The LC25 values of the insecticides, LD25 values of the inert dusts and LTi25 values of high temperatures were estimated and used for determining combination effects of the two factors. To determine combination effects of three factors, LC15 values of insecticides, LD15 values of inert dusts and LTi15 values of high temperatures were estimated and used in the bioassays. The LC50 and LD50 values for cypermethrin, dichlorvos, ash and kaolin were 1286.96 mg a. i./L, 1350.55 mg a. i./L, 36.64 g/m(2) and 45.18 g/m(2), respectively. The LTi50 values at 45, 48, 50, 52 and 55 degrees C were 34, 29,18,11 and 8 min, respectively. The results indicated that the effect of simultaneous exposure to cypermethrin, high temperatures and ash or kaolin was significantly more than sum of individual effects of these factors. It means the effects of cypermethrin, high temperatures and inert dusts were synergized by each other. If similar treatments performed at larger scales give comparable results, it may be concluded that reduced dosage of cypermethrin, high temperatures and ash or kaolin combinations would be effective alternative control methods and can be used in cowpea seed beetle management programs.

Understanding predator-prey responses to climate change-induced environmental perturbations may foster optimal efficacy in vector reduction. However, organisms may differentially respond to heterogeneous thermal environments, potentially destabilizing predator-prey trophic systems. Methods Here, we explored the critical thermal limits of activity (CTLs; critical thermal-maxima [CTmax] and minima [CTmin]) of key predator-prey species. We concurrently examined CTL asynchrony of two notonectid predators (Anisops sardea and Enithares chinai) and one copepod predator (Lovenula falcifera) as well as larvae of three vector mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles quadriannulatus and Culex pipiens, across instar stages (early, 1st; intermediate, 2nd/3rd; late, 4th). Results Overall, predators and prey differed significantly in CTmax and CTmin. Predators generally had lower CTLs than mosquito prey, dependent on prey instar stage and species, with first instars having the lowest CTmax (lowest warm tolerance), but also the lowest CTmin (highest cold tolerance). For predators, L. falcifera exhibited the narrowest CTLs overall, with E. chinai having the widest and A. sardea intermediate CTLs, respectively. Among prey species, the global invader Ae. aegypti consistently exhibited the highest CTmax, whilst differences among CTmin were inconsistent among prey species according to instar stage. Conclusion These results point to significant predator-prey mismatches under environmental change, potentially adversely affecting natural mosquito biocontrol given projected shifts in temperature fluctuations in the study region. The overall narrower thermal breadth of native predators relative to larval mosquito prey may reduce natural biotic resistance to pests and harmful mosquito species, with implications for population success and potentially vector capacity under global change.",no,,,,,PARASITES & VECTORS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1756-3305,NA,2020,10.1186/s13071-020-04479-3,WOS:000597964100004

This study tests mountain pine beetle flight capacity in the laboratory under different abiotic conditions including temperature, light and wind speed. Beetle flight capacity was tested under different temperatures before and during flight and different light regimes in separate computer-linked flight mill bioassays. A wind tunnel experiment tested the effect of wind speed on beetle flight. Pre-flight temperature and temperature during flight did not affect beetle flight capacity (distance or duration). Beetles do, however, use more energy during flight at high temperatures, which could affect host colonization following dispersal by flight of mountain pine beetle in nature. Beetles fly a greater distance and longer duration during a long (18 h) than short (16 h) photophase, suggesting that increased day length with a northern range expansion could affect beetle flight capacity.

Finding win-win solutions for pest control management in sustainable and profitable agriculture is a current yet elusive challenge for human societies. The main alternative to reduce pest damage in a sustainable manner consists in fostering natural enemies through the extensification of agricultural practices or the promotion of heterogeneous landscapes. However, very few studies have analyzed the combined effects of these components on natural enemies and pests simultaneously. In this work, we fit meta-models (using Piecewise Structural Equation Models) aiming to understand the direct and indirect effects of agricultural management, landscape heterogeneity and climatic variables on insectivorous birds, pest abundance and crop damage. For this, we focus on olive groves, one of the most important woody agroecosystems worldwide, and its two main pest species. We found that management extensification and landscape heterogeneity benefited pest control and supported more insectivorous birds. Also, high temperatures diminished pest damage. Compared to landscape and temperature effects, abundance/richness of insectivorous birds were poor predictors of pest abundance and damage, suggesting that other natural enemies might be currently more important for pest control in olive groves. Lastly, we found a decoupled response of pest abundance and pest damage that may be attributed to insecticide use. This suggests that predation pressure by birds might predict better pest abundance than pest damage in our system. Current predation pressure by birds against pests in olive groves seems very low. Fostering extensive management and landscape heterogeneity increases the abundance of insectivorous birds in this system, potentially enhancing the pest control service.",yes,field,damage,,,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0167-8809,1873-2305,2020,10.1016/j.agee.2020.107145,WOS:000581101600019

The population density of N. elegantalis was sampled weekly after tomato fruits reached a diameter >= 0.5 cm until the final harvest, over 15 commercial tomato fields. Egg abundance and mortality, larval abundance and mortality, and pupae abundance was determined within each sample. Rain, photoperiod, wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity was monitored daily. The highest densities of N. elegantalis eggs, larvae, and pupae occurred between March and July. After July, N. elegantalis density was drastically reduced. Path analysis revealed that temperature, rainfall, and photoperiod had a significant and direct effect on N. elegantalis egg abundance, which indirectly affected larval and pupal densities. The path coefficient indicated a negative correlation between the number of N. elegantalis eggs and the photoperiod, while air temperature and rainfall had a positive effect on theses densities.

As two of the most important pests worldwide of cereal production, Rhopalosiphum padi primarily dominates stems and basal leaves of wheat plants, whereas Sitobion avenae is common on the upper leaves and ears. Here, we investigated this microniche separation by considering effects of food resources and microclimates on the behavior and performance of R. padi and S. avenae on tissues from individual wheat seedlings. Wheat leaves provided favorable food for both aphid species and this tissue had high free amino acid and low soluble sugar compared with wheat stems. Both species preferred microclimates in the lower area of the seedlings where humidity was relatively higher and temperatures were relatively lower. In terms of performance, R. padi was more sensitive to microclimate effects than S. avenae, while the latter species was relatively more sensitive to limiting food resources. These factors may help explain why R. padi is relatively more common on lower microhabitats of seedlings, in contrast to S. avenae, contributing to the microspatial distribution of these species more generally.

It has been recorded recently in the northwestern border areas of China, posing a significant threat to tomato production. It was presumed that the region's winter-related low temperatures would avert the alien species from successfully overwintering. In this study, the supercooling capacity and low-temperature tolerance of this pest were examined under laboratory conditions and its overwintering potential in Xinjiang was estimated. The results showed that the lowest supercooling point was recorded in the adult stage (- 19.47 degrees C), while the highest (- 18.11 degrees C) was recorded in the pupal stage. The supercooling points of pupae and adults were not influenced by gender. The Ltemp(50) and Ltemp(90) of female and male adults were the lowest when exposed to cold for 2 h. However, when the duration of exposure extended from 4 to 10 h, the Ltemp(50) and Ltemp(90) of female and male pupae were the lowest. Comparison of the lowest Ltemp(50) and Ltemp(90) with temperatures in January indicated that T. absoluta might not be able to overwinter in most of the northern and central regions of Xinjiang. However, in the southern regions, the extremely low temperature was higher than the Ltemp(90), suggesting that T. absoluta has a higher overwintering potential in these regions.

However, unlike climate change, future land use and ecological interactions are unpredictable. One strategy for confronting this unpredictability is to use interdisciplinary approaches. Objectives In this paper we demonstrate how historical ecology and SDM modeling can be combined to reconstruct the impacts of land use change, invasive pathogens, and climate change upon the landscape of the Monte Pisano of Central Italy over the last two centuries. Methods Species distribution and climate modeling are combined with early nineteenth century land use records and oral history, in order to reconstruct changes in species distributions of sweet chestnut and maritime pine on the Monte Pisano (Central Italy). Results The extent of pine forest tripled while chestnut forest halved since 1850. Climatic conditions changed, with temperatures increasing by over 1.5 degrees C. These climatic changes are insufficient to account for the shift in chestnut and pine distribution, which was mainly driven by socioeconomic change that caused changes in land use, a process accelerated by pathogens that eliminated low elevation chestnut groves. Conclusions In Mediterranean mountains, where human activities have impacted biota for a long time, changes in land management and climate change interacting on different temporal scales, can affect the magnitude of changes in species distributions.

The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius, 1889), is ranked among the world's 100 most invasive insect pests and is a major threat to many important cash and staple food crops. In this study, we identified levels and areas at risk of the invasive B. tabaci at a landscape scale in Kenya using elevation, land surface temperature, land cover, rainfall, and temperature of the present and future (the year 2050 of the community climate system model version 4 (CCSM4)), and using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. Our results show that similar to 14% of Kenya's land area is currently at risk of B. tabaci invasion. This area is likely to increase to 15% and 16% because of climate change using the representative concentration pathways (RCP) i.e. RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 of the year 2050, respectively. Land cover, particularly croplands, provided the highest permutation importance together with precipitation variables in determining the occurrence of the pest.

In recent years, winter temperature has dropped in these regions, and extremely low temperatures are hard to survive for insects. Cold hardiness becomes a crucial strategy because temperature change often leads to fluctuations in insect abundance, and the metabolism rate is a key index of resistance to cold in overwintering insects. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the change in respiratory rate and the activity of metabolism-related mitochondrial enzymes in D. armandi larvae under cold conditions. We found that the respiratory rate decreased, and it was matched with the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase, aconitase, and lipase during overwintering. Among the various test times under cold conditions, the respiratory rate also decreased with decreasing temperature and increased under very low temperatures. At all cold stress periods, glutamate dehydrogenase and lipase showed increased activity at higher temperatures and decreased activity under lower temperatures, but the activity of NAD-malic enzyme, NADP-malic enzyme, mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase, and aconitase were contrary. Under all low temperatures, the activity of enzymes - except for NADP-malic enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase, and lipase - increased in short-term cold stress and decreased in long-term cold stress at 4, 0, -4, -6, -8, and -10 degrees C. However, at -2 degrees C, the activity of enzymes showed a decreasing trend in short-term treatments and an increasing trend in long-term treatments, except for mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase.

The European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is a generalist forest defoliator introduced to Medford, Massachusetts, USA in 1869. The invasion front extends from Minnesota to North Carolina and the ability of this species to adapt to local climate may contribute to its continuing spread.

The responses of survival, pupal mass and larval development time were analysed as a function of source climate (annual mean normal temperature), rearing temperature and their interaction using multiple polynomial regression. Results With the exception of female development time, there were no significant interactions between source climate and rearing temperature, indicating little divergence in the shape of thermal reaction norms among populations. Source population and rearing temperature were significant predictors of survival and pupal mass. Independent of rearing temperature, populations from warmer climates had lower survival than those from colder climates, but attained larger body size despite similar development times. Larval development time was dependent on rearing temperature, but there were not consistent relationships with source climate.

We addressed two key questions: (1) Do the mortality rates caused by a factor vary by season? And (2) how does the local weather contribute to such variation? We identified five causes of mortality (failure, pathogens, parasitism, predation and rainfall) that together tended to be higher during wet-warm conditions with values up to 94%. However, each cause and its mortality rate varied among seasons. Failure was observed in all stages and tended to increase during cold conditions with a negative relationship with air temperature and relative humidity and positive for precipitation. Larval and pupal predation increased during warm conditions and was positively associated with both air temperature and relative humidity. Conversely, in seasons with intense precipitation, pupal predation was reduced and had a negative relationship. Rainfall caused mortality of eggs and larvae, mostly during intense events, and egg mortality also showed a positive and significant association with precipitation. Larval parasitism was low, and pathogens were noted in larvae and pupae, but we did not find variation by season for these factors.

This work extends the application of a physiologically based model in the case study of D. suzukii, providing a validation in the case of an insect pest relevant in agriculture, and an accurate estimation of a set of biological parameters. The Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), is a harmful insect pest for soft fruit cultivations. Even though its main hosts belong to the genera Prunus and Rubus, its high polyphagy and adaptability to new environments makes it a serious problem for farmers worldwide, who have reported several economic losses because of this pest. A wide series of proposals to control SWD are available and operate in line with the mechanisms of integrated pest management, demonstrating their high efficiency when applied at the opportune moment. This work aims to apply and validate a physiologically based model which summarises all the available information about D. suzukii biology, such as the relationship between environmental temperature and its development, fertility and mortality rates. The model provided, as a result, a description of a population of SWD females taking into consideration the multiple generations that occurred during the year. Simulations were then compared with field data collected in a three-year survey in two experimental fields located in the Sabina Romana area (Lazio, Italy). More specifically, D. suzukii males were monitored with traps in fields cultivated with mixed varieties of cherries and they were selected because of their clearer identification in comparison to females. Results showed a high level of reliability of simulations in representing the field data, highlighting at the same time that there is no discrepancy in simulating D. suzukii females in order to represent male populations.",no,,,,,INSECTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,2075-4450,2020,10.3390/insects11110751,WOS:000594025200001

Through the last three decades, however, there have been concerns about the decline of pine forests attributed mostly to pests and pathogens. A combination of biotic agents and environmental factors and their interaction often influences outbreaks and the resultant damage in the forests. Southern pines experience periodic mortality from bark beetles and root rot fungi and losses from fusiform rust and pitch canker have long been important for management. In recent years, there is also growing evidence of increasing damage from foliar disease in southern pines. Early detection of diseases following changes in foliar characteristics and assessment of potential risks will help us better utilize our resources and manage these forests sustainably. In this study, we used Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to explore the intensity of foliar disease in three common pines: loblolly (Pinus taeda L.), longleaf (Pinus palustris Mill.), and slash (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) in spatial and temporal terms using tree-level and climatic variables. Results from a tree-level model suggests that crown ratio may be an important factor in pine foliar disease (p < 0.1). We applied the MaxEnt model, a presence-only species distribution model (SDM), to explore any association of foliar disease incidences with the climatic variables at a landscape level. Results indicate that mean dew point temperature, maximum vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation during cold months had more influence over disease incidences than other climatic variables. While the sample size is limited as this is an emerging disease in the region, our study provides a basis for further exploration of disease detection methods, disease etiology studies, and hazard mapping.",no,,,,,FORESTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,1999-4907,2020,10.3390/f11111155,WOS:000593175400001

However, introducing insects to temperatures outside of their accustomed range can lead to stress and thereby influence their quality and competitiveness in the field. Bactrocera dorsalis is an economically important pest can devastate many fruits and vegetables, and cold storage has been used in storing, packing and shipping of sterile B. dorsalis males to control the wild population, but the impact of cold storage on the quality of B. dorsalis has never been investigated. Here, we examined the impacts of pupal cold storage on developmental parameters and quality of B. dorsalis adults. Overall, we found that pupal cold storage has a negative effect on some biological parameters of B. dorsalis, especially in fecundity. Thus, heat exposure was further conducted on the post-storage adults, and our results show that short-term heat exposure could partially compensate for the loss in fecundity in B. dorsalis adults resulting from the pupal cold storage. Our findings indicate that the flexibility of the B. dorsalis mass rearing program could be improved by utilizing cold storage and heat exposure. Cold storage and heat exposure are crucial components of tephritid fruit fly mass-rearing programs, as they influence the development and fitness traits of produced flies. This work investigated the effects of cold storage on the pupal developmental parameters and quality of Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) genetic sexing strain (GSS) adults. Furthermore, the impact of short-term thermal exposure on the fecundity of B. dorsalis (GSS) that also underwent pupal cold storage was examined. Our results show that pupal development time, emergence rate, partial emergence rate, flight ability and fecundity were significantly affected by low temperature and pupal age and their interaction. Pupal cold storage did not pose negative impacts on the mating competition and response to methyl eugenol (ME) in the males. In addition, compared with the adults that were subjected to the same pupal storage protocol (five-day-old pupae stored at 13 degrees C), adult exposure to 41 degrees C for 1 h showed significant reparative effects on fecundity. In summary, the cold storage procedure of B. dorsalis (GSS) pupae has the potential to improve the flexibility and efficiency of mass-rearing schedules. Furthermore, short-term thermal exposure showed reparative effects on the fecundity costs induced by pupal cold storage in B. dorsalis (GSS).",no,,,,,INSECTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,2075-4450,2020,10.3390/insects11110821,WOS:000593247500001

Models to forecast slug populations make assumptions about growth and mortality in response to environmental factors. To refine these models, we studied the effect of hatching season on the growth and survival of Deroceras reticulatum, a worldwide pest. Slugs hatching in spring and autumn were compared at three rearing temperatures (ambient, 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C). Deroceras reticulatum reared under identical conditions showed great variation in growth and strong bimodality in growth rates. At all rearing temperatures, growth was influenced by hatching season; in all cases, fast growers dominated in autumn and slow growers dominated in spring. Deroceras reticulatum populations may be partitioned into slow growers and fast growers. Fast growers responded to warmer conditions, growing to large sizes. Slow growers, in contrast, gained weight at comparable rates to ambient reared slugs, regardless of the elevated constant temperatures. The peaks of slug activity seen in the field in autumn and spring are possibly not distinct generations as some slugs may mature early/late and slip into the alternative cohort. Rather, the observed autumn and spring peaks in slug numbers may be a response of a mixed-age population to the favourable environmental conditions at that time.

Potato is a secondary host of the species but the major threat from this insect in the Andean region for potato is the transmission by this insect of a crinivirus causing Potato yellow vein disease. Determination of the pest's temperature-dependent population growth potential is crucial knowledge for understanding the population dynamics and spread potential of the species and the diseases it can transmit, as well as for designing effective pest management strategies. Trialeurodes vaporariorum development, mortality and reproduction were studied at seven constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32 degrees C. The Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software was used to fit nonlinear equations to the data and establish an overall phenology model to simulate life-table parameters based on temperature. In addition, life tables of T. vaporarionum were established at daily fluctuating temperature in two different environments: Cusco (5 degrees C-35 degrees C) and La Molina, Lima (13.7 degrees C-24.9 degrees C), and used to adjust and validate the model. The insect only completed its life cycle at constant temperatures above 15 degrees C and below 32 degrees C although the cycle was completed at daily fluctuating temperatures between 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The overall model portrayed population development within the temperature range of 14 degrees to 32 degrees C with a maximum finite rate of population increase (= 1.14) at 23 degrees C. However, the model revealed poor convergence with life tables established at fluctuating temperatures indicating an influential effect of temperature fluctuations on the whitefly life history parameters, particularly on adult survival time and reproduction. Therefore, we adjusted the model for convergence with a single life table observed at fluctuating temperature. The adjusted model gave good predictions when compared with remaining observed life tables and published data. The adjusted model predicted population development within the temperature range of 11.5 degrees C-35.5 degrees C, and maximum population growth at around 24 degrees C with a finite rate of increase, lambda, of 1.137 and a population doubling time of 5 days. The established process-based physiological model presented here for T. vaporariorum can be used for predicting the species distribution potential based on temperature worldwide and should prove helpful in adjusting pest management measures.

Chemical control is the main control method against B. tabaci; biological control practices, however, have also been applied against this pest, especially in greenhouse production systems. Due to its parasitism potential and adaptation to environmental conditions of the Mediterranean region, Eretmocerus mundus Mercet (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) is considered one of the most successful biological control agents of B. tabaci. In mass production, having adequate numbers of natural enemies is critical for the augmentative biological control programs. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of stored indigenous Er. mundus on B. tabaci under greenhouse conditions. In storage experiments, red-eyed Er. mundus pupae were stored separately for 4, 8 and 12 days at 5 and 10 degrees C with 45 +/- 5% RH conditions. The most suitable storage duration and temperature were determined as 8 days and 10 degrees C for the greenhouse release experiments. In the greenhouse experiments, the treatments consisted of B. tabaci release (control), stored and unstored Er. mundus releases in the Spring of 2015 and 2016 growth seasons. For the evaluation of population development of whitefly and the parasitoid, leaf samples were taken at five-day intervals. In both years, similar parasitism fluctuations were detected in stored and unstored parasitoid-released treatments, wherein initially-lower parasitism rates showed a dramatic increase at later sampling dates. In general, statistical parasitism rates of stored and unstored Er. mundus populations were found in the same group for 2015 and 2016.

Climate change is threatening sustainable wheat production not only with direct negative effects on crop growth but also with a profound impact on pest biology and management. This review presents a critical analysis of the impact of key climate change elements, including drought, high temperature and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels on biology, ecology and behaviour of wheat pests. Climate change is expected to favour the growth, virulence, multiplication, persistence and range expansion of most serious wheat pests. Rapid climatic changes are opening new geographic windows for disease outbreaks, insect attacks and weed infestations in wheat crops across the globe. Wheat-pest interactions are also favourable for pests in most cases where one or more climate change elements come into play. Existing pest management options are not successful under these circumstances. Climate change has a direct negative effect on the efficacy of existing control options, which increases pest virulence and their competitive ability, pest resistance to pesticides and pest-environment interactions, leading to inadequate pest control and substantial crop yield losses. Integrated pest management approaches, based on innovative and traditional pest control strategies, may be more appropriate in the changing climate. Proactive measures, including early detection and eradication by frequent pest-scouting, preventive control, and forecasting of potential outbreaks or new introductions by predictive modelling, could help in this regard.

The wasp then began to spread by stratified dispersal, with the local abundance increasing thereafter. In this study, we analysed location data on wasp-attacked trees, with the following aims: (i) to determine the relative importance of short distance dispersal (SDD) and long-distance dispersal (LDD) on the geographical expansion of the wasp; and (ii) to assess whether the spatial clusters of areas with high and low numbers of attacked trees correspond to areas with different infestation levels and thus whether these areas can be considered suitable proxies for pest abundance. A Random Forest algorithm was used to identify the factors that best discriminate hotspot and coldspot areas. Distance matrix analysis was used considering a conservative expansion rate of the population front of 14 km/year as the threshold for distinguishing SDD and LDD events. Gradients of attacked tree abundance were delineated using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. Although LDD events represented a small proportion of the locally dispersing offspring, they determined the rate of spread across the landscape. The infestation level differed significantly between hotspot and coldspot areas, which were therefore used as proxies for D. kuriphilus population abundance. Factors that were favourable or unfavourable in relation to population abundance were mainly associated with maximum temperatures in the summer months.

J,"Raderschall, CA; Vico, G; Lundin, O; Taylor, AR; Bommarco, R",Water stress and insect herbivory interactively reduce crop yield while the insect pollination benefit is conserved,"Climate change is predicted to hamper crop production due to precipitation deficits and warmer temperatures inducing both water stress and increasing herbivory due to more abundant insect pests. Consequently, crop yields will be impacted simultaneously by abiotic and biotic stressors. Extensive yield losses due to such climate change stressors might, however, be mitigated by ecosystem services such as insect pollination. We examined the single and combined effects of water stress, insect herbivory and insect pollination on faba bean yield components and above- and belowground plant biomass under realistic field conditions. We used rainout shelters to simulate a scenario in line with climate change projections, with adequate water supply at sowing followed by a long period without precipitation. This induced a gradually increasing water stress, culminating around crop flowering and yield formation. We found that gradually increasing water stress combined with insect herbivory by aphids interactively shaped yield in faba beans. Individually, aphid herbivory reduced yield by 79% and water stress reduced yield by 52%. However, the combined effect of water stress and aphid herbivory reduced yield less (84%) than the sum of the individual stressor effects. In contrast, insect pollination increased yield by 68% independently of water availability and insect herbivory. Our results suggest that yield losses can be greatly reduced when both water stress and insect herbivory are reduced simultaneously. In contrast, reducing only one stressor has negligible benefits on yield as long as the crop is suffering from the other stressor.

Knowledge of the impact of temperature on its development and survival is important to understand the risks of this species spreading to other regions and to develop phenological models for pest management. This study evaluated the effects of temperature on the development and survival ofS. eridaniaand selected mathematical models to simulate its development. RESULTS The southern armyworm completed its development between 15 and 32 degrees C, but eggs did not hatch at 34 degrees C. Lower survival and higher rates of deformities in adults were recorded at 15 and 32 degrees C. Among the ten mathematical models evaluated, Briere-2, Lactin-2 and Shi were considered suitable for describing the temperature-dependent development rate ofS. eridania. The lower thermal threshold estimated by these models for the egg to adult life cycle ranged from 10.8 to 12.1 degrees C, whereas the upper threshold ranged between 33.9 and 35.0 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS The southern armyworm can develop within a wide range of temperatures, which partially explains its wide distribution in regions with different climatic conditions, and demonstrates its potential to occur in regions outside its native range.

We addressed two key questions: (1) Do the mortality rates caused by a factor vary by season? And (2) how does the local weather contribute to such variation? We identified five causes of mortality (failure, pathogens, parasitism, predation and rainfall) that together tended to be higher during wet-warm conditions with values up to 94%. However, each cause and its mortality rate varied among seasons. Failure was observed in all stages and tended to increase during cold conditions with a negative relationship with air temperature and relative humidity and positive for precipitation. Larval and pupal predation increased during warm conditions and was positively associated with both air temperature and relative humidity. Conversely, in seasons with intense precipitation, pupal predation was reduced and had a negative relationship. Rainfall caused mortality of eggs and larvae, mostly during intense events, and egg mortality also showed a positive and significant association with precipitation. Larval parasitism was low, and pathogens were noted in larvae and pupae, but we did not find variation by season for these factors.

However, the indirect effects of interactions between herbivores and their biotic environment at the same temperatures will potentially counter such direct effects. This study examines the potential for intraspecific competition to dampen the effects of optimal temperatures on fitness (survival x reproduction) of the brown planthopper,Nilaparvata lugens[BPH] and whitebacked planthopper,Sogatella furcifera[WBPH], two phloem-feeders that attack rice in Asia. We conducted a series of experiments with increasing densities of ovipositing females and developing nymphs on tropical and temperate rice varieties at 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Damage from planthoppers to the tropical variety was greater at 30 degrees C compared to 25 degrees C, despite faster plant growth rates at 30 degrees C. Damage to the temperate variety from WBPH nymphs was greatest at 25 degrees C. BPH nymphs gained greater biomass at 25 degrees C than at 30 degrees C despite faster development at the higher temperature (temperature-size rule); however, the effect was apparent only at high nymph densities.

Temperature has little effect on oviposition responses to density, and intraspecific competition between females only weakly counters the effects of optimal temperatures on oviposition in both BPH and WBPH. Meanwhile, the deleterious effects of nymph crowding will counter the direct effects of optimal temperatures on voltinism in BPH and on body size in both BPH and WBPH.

A more holistic approach to the analysis of its thermal biology is essential background for developing models to assess its invasive potential. Our studies found that SATP has lower and upper thermal thresholds(theta(L) = 5.37 degrees C and theta(U)= 35.69 degrees C, respectively) than South American populations used in prior studies (theta(L)= 7.38 degrees C and theta(U)= 33.82 degrees C). Age-specific life tables were used to estimate the effects of temperature on its demographic parameters. Diapause in SATP had not been characterized prior to our study. We found facultative diapause in pupae developing from larvae exposed to relatively low temperatures (i.e., 2 and 5 degrees C) and short-day length for different exposure periods. The strength of diapause was measured as an increase in post-treatment developmental times of pupae (i.e., degree days) that on average were 2.45-3-fold greater than of pupae reared at favorable temperatures.

In this study, the effects of low temperatures (8, 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, and -4 degrees C) on the development and reproduction of these two closely related fruit fly species were studied under laboratory condition. The results showed that their survival rates decreased gradually with corresponding decreases in the tested temperatures. On the other hand, their pre-oviposition periods and their adult female to male sex ratios increased, while the average number of eggs per female of each species and longevity of male adult of B. cucurbitae initially increased and later decreased after exposure to the low-temperature treatments.

However, the biological characteristics of A. sinensis remain largely unknown, which can hinder the prediction of its population dynamics.Thus, understanding the impact of temperature on the developmental period of A. sinensis is crucial to predict its population dynamics. The biological characteristics of A sinensis were systematically observed at five different temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 degrees C) using the age-stage, two-sex life table method.The results demonstrated that the developmental period, preadult time, adult longevity, adult preoviposition period, and total preoviposition period were significantly reduced when the temperature was elevated from 16 to 32 degrees C.

In this study, we built a model to predict the potential distribution of A. custos under current and future climatic conditions for supporting its current and future use. Currently, the potential highly suitable areas of A. custos are mainly distributed in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang Provinces. Under the climate change scenarios of RCP2.6, 4.5, 8.5 in the 2050s and 2070s, the suitable areas for A. custos will decrease and shift towards Northeast China. Considering the currently suitable distribution area of S. frugiperda, artificially reared A. custos is suitable for release in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and southeastern Sichuan Provinces under the current climatic condition. Under the future climate scenarios, Northeast China is not suitable for the survival of S. frugiperda. Thus, A. custos does not need to be released here. Spodoptera frugiperda is a notorious pest that feeds on more than 80 crops, and has spread over 100 countries. Many biological agents have been employed to regulate it, such as Arma custos. A. custos is a polyphagous predatory heteropteran, which can effectively suppress several agricultural and forest pests. Thus, in order to understand where A. custos can survive and where can be released, MaxEnt was used to predict the potentially suitable areas for A. custos in China under climate change conditions. The results show that the annual mean temperature (bio1) and annual precipitation (bio12) are the major factors influencing the distribution of A. custos.

Current treatments rely on chemicals, but both species have developed resistance to most of these. However, by understanding the ecology of these species in regional locations it is possible to develop more targeted pest management strategies. Therefore, we conducted a 2-year trapping study to investigate for the first time the spatial and temporal activity of these two species in a temperate region of southeastern Australia. Traps were located both on and off farms. Of the two species LGB were more common, and higher numbers of both species were found in traps close to grain storages. However, they both had a wide distribution as they were caught in all traps. Both species displayed distinct seasonal trends, with activity stopping over the colder, winter months in both years. The lack of activity is partly a response to the colder temperatures, with flight activity stopping below 14.5 degrees C for LGB and 15.6 degrees C for RFB. These results can be used to inform pest management activities such as cleaning of storages, monitoring for insects, resistance management, and site hygiene. The lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica, and the rust red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, are two major beetle pests commonly found infesting stored products worldwide. Both species can cause severe economic damage and their management is complicated by their potential to develop resistance to several of the limited chemical options available. However, pest management strategies can be improved by understanding the ecology of the pest insect. To determine the spatiotemporal activity of R. dominica and T. castaneum, we conducted a trapping study over two years in a temperate region of south-eastern Australia, with traps located near grain storages and fields. We captured higher numbers of R. dominica than T. castaneum, and both species were more prevalent in traps located close to grain storages. Similar and consistent seasonal patterns were displayed by both species with activity ceasing during the winter (June-August) months. We found linear correlations between maximum daily temperatures and trap catches, and minimum threshold temperatures for flight activity were 14.5 degrees C and 15.6 degrees C for R. dominica and T. castaneum, respectively.

However, their combined agronomic, ecological, and socio-economic performance compared to monocultures is still largely unknown. Here we present a meta-analysis of 52 articles that directly compared cocoa agroforestry systems and monocultures. Using an inductive, multi-dimensional approach, we analyzed the differences in cocoa and total system yield, economic performance, soil chemical and physical properties, incidence of pests and diseases, potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and biodiversity conservation. Cocoa agroforestry systems outcompeted monocultures in most indicators. Cocoa yields in agroforestry systems were 25% lower than in monocultures, but total system yields were about ten times higher, contributing to food security and diversified incomes. This finding was supported by a similar profitability of both production systems. Cocoa agroforestry contributed to climate change mitigation by storing 2.5 times more carbon and to adaptation by lowering mean temperatures and buffering temperature extremes. We found no significant differences in relation to the main soil parameters. The effect of the type of production system on disease incidence depended on the fungal species.

Spotted gums (Corymbia citriodora and C. hentyi), C. torelliana, and their hybrids are important commercial plantation taxa, because they are suited to a range of environments where traditional commercial eucalypts grow poorly. They have desirable field performance and can produce a range of timber and fibre products. This study investigated field performance, ontogenetic shifts from juvenile to intermediate leaves, and damage by pests and pathogens in pure spotted gum taxa, including C. citriodora subsp. citriodora (CCC), C. citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV) and C. hentyi (CH), C. torelliana (CT), and their hybrids over a two year period. The study revealed that higher mean daily rainfall and maximum/minimum temperatures positively influenced tree performance but were also associated with higher levels of defoliation by generalist insects. Necrosis associated with Quambalaria pitereka was not correlated with climatic conditions in most of the taxa. Growth rate and defoliation were positively correlated, while flushing and damage parameters (defoliation and leaf necrosis) were often negatively correlated, suggesting that the taxa studied may have high tolerance to defoliation. Ontogenetic shifts were variable between taxa, occurring earlier in pure spotted gum taxa than in hybrids. The only environmental factor related to the transition from juvenile to intermediate leaves was mean daily rainfall, suggesting that ontogenetic shifts may be associated with an adaptation to water availability. Overall, CCC and CT x CCC displayed the best combination of performance and resistance to pests and pathogens. Severe defoliation was associated with reduced diameter at breast height over bark (DBH) in CCV and CH.

Under controlled conditions, the leaf nitrogen concentration increased slightly with light intensity (p= .003). The same trend was seen in stems but only at 30 degrees C. In the field, the impact of overhead shade on nitrogen varied between cocoa clones. The concentration of carbohydrates in both leaves and stems in the field was higher under unshaded conditions. When subjected to feeding tests, stems from unshaded cocoa had significantly more mirid feeding lesions (p= .003) after 24 hr exposure to mirids compared to shaded cocoa. Mirid feeding therefore appears not to be deterred by the higher phenolic levels but rather there was a preference for cocoa tissue grown under unshaded conditions. These findings highlight the need to consider the growing environment of cocoa clones when screening for varieties with resistance to mirids.",yes,both,laboratory,damage,,ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0003-4746,1744-7348,2020,10.1111/aab.12636,WOS:000569025700001

Among these xylomycetophagous insects,Xylosandrus compactus(Eichhoff) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a serious threat for several Mediterranean host plants. Carob trees growing in Sicily (Italy) have been extensively attacked by beetles leading to rapid tree decline. AlthoughX.compactushas been found in Europe for several years, most aspects of its ecology are still unknown. We thus studied the population structure and dynamics ofX.compactus, together with its twig size preference during a sampling of infested carob trees in south east Sicily. In addition, fungi associated with insects or galleries were isolated and characterized. The results showed that, in this newly-colonized environment and host plant, adultX.compactusoverwinters inside twigs and starts to fly and reproduce in mid spring, completing five generations before overwintering in late fall. The mean diameter of carob twigs infested by the beetle varied significantly over the seasons, with the insect tending to infest larger twigs as season progresses. The mean number of adults/gallery was 19.21, ranging from 6 to 28. The minimum temperature significantly affected the overwintering adult mortality.Ambrosiella xyleboriandFusarium solaniwere the main symbionts associated with the pest in this study.Acremoniumsp. was instead recorded for the first time in Europe insideX.compactusgalleries.

It remains unknown whether shifts in species' climatic suitability will be linear or rather non-linear, with crop exposure to pests suddenly increasing when a critical temperature threshold is crossed. Moreover, uncertainty of forecasts can arise because of the modelling approach based either on species distribution data or on physiological measurements. Here, we compared the predictions of two modelling approaches (physiological models and species distribution models) for forecasting the potential distribution of agricultural insect pests in Europe. Despite conceptual differences, we found good agreement overall between the two approaches. We further identified a potential regime change in pest pressure along a temperature gradient. With both modelling approaches, we found an inflection point in the number of pest species with suitable climatic conditions around a minimum temperature of the coldest month of -3 degrees C.

The yields of cassava are, however, relatively low in Nigeria largely due to pests and disease infections that significantly lead to inconsistencies in productivity of cassava genotypes in various environments. Fifty-eight F(1)hybrid cassava genotypes plus their two parents which served as check varieties were evaluated in three locations for two years (that is six environments). The objectives of the study were to evaluate genotype by environment interactions (GEI) on resistance to cassava green mite [CGM,Mononychellus tanajoa(Bondar)] associated traits and effects on yield performance of cassava genotypes in Nigeria and to identify superior genotypes that exhibit high stability which combine CGM resistance and high fresh root yield with general and specific environmental adaptation using additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype stability index (GSI). The combined analysis of variance based on AMMI revealed significant genotype, environment, and genotype by environment interactions (GEI) for all traits. The percentage variation due to environment was higher than the percentage variation due to genotype for cassava green mite severity (CGMS), leaf retention (LR), root dry matter content (RDMC), and fresh root yield (FRY) indicating that environment greatly influenced the expression of these traits. The percentage variation due to GEI accounted for higher percentage variation than that of genotype and environment separately for all traits, indicating the influence of genotype by environment interaction on expression of the traits. These findings reveal that screening/evaluating for these traits needs multi-environment trials. According to GSI ranking, genotypes G31 (IBA131794), G19 (IBA131762), the check variety G52 (TMEB778), and G11 (IBA131748) were identified as the most stable and most resistant to CGM which also combine high FRY and other useful agronomic traits, implying that these traits in cassava can even be incorporated as preferred by farmers.

When multiple natural enemy species share a host, shifts in host-parasitoid dynamics could depend on whether natural enemies interact antagonistically vs. synergistically. We investigated how biotic and abiotic factors influence the population ecology of larch casebearer (Coleophora laricella), a nonnative pest, and two imported parasitoids,Agathis pumilaandChrysocharis laricinellae, by analyzing (1) temporal dynamics in defoliation from 1962 to 2018, and (2) historical, branch-level data on densities of larch casebearer and parasitism rates by the two imported natural enemies from 1972 to 1995. Analyses of defoliation indicated that, prior to the widespread establishment of parasitoids (1962 to similar to 1980), larch casebearer outbreaks occurred in 2-6 yr cycles. This pattern was followed by a >15-yr period during which populations were at low, apparently stable densities undetectable via aerial surveys, presumably under control from parasitoids. However, since the late 1990s and despite the persistence of both parasitoids, outbreaks exhibiting unstable dynamics have occurred. Analyses of branch-level data indicated that growth of casebearer populations,A. pumilapopulations, and within-casebearer densities ofC. laricinellae-a generalist whose population dynamics are likely also influenced by use of alternative hosts-were inhibited by density dependence, with high intraspecific densities in one year slowing growth into the next. Casebearer population growth was also inhibited by parasitism fromA. pumila, but notC. laricinellae, and increased with warmer autumnal temperatures. Growth ofA. pumilapopulations and within-casebearer densities ofC. laricinellaeincreased with casebearer densities but decreased with warmer annual maximum temperatures. Moreover, parasitism byA. pumilawas associated with increased growth of within-casebearer densities ofC. laricinellaewithout adverse effects on its own demographics, indicating a synergistic interaction between these parasitoids. Our results indicate that warming can be associated with opposing effects between trophic levels, with deleterious effects of warming on one natural enemy species potentially being exacerbated by similar impacts on another.

To understand how maize yield loss is affected by global warming, daily precipitation and temperatures, together with provincial agricultural data sets, were analyzed. The results showed that the accumulated temperature, an important factor in agricultural productivity, increased by 5% in 1991-2017, compared to 1961-1990, and that the frequency of low temperatures decreased by 14.8% over the same time period. An increase in drought by 21.6% was observed from 1961-1990 to 1991-2017, caused by decreased growing-season precipitation by -4 mm/decade. In addition, days with heavy rain in August and September increased slightly in Northeast China. In general, maize growth responded positively to the increased thermal conditions; in 1961-1990, 22.7% of observed maize yield-loss cases were due to low temperatures, but only 10% in 1991-2017. However, during the same time, the number of drought-induced yield loss cases increased from 27.3% to 46.7%. Moreover, yield loss cases caused by heavy rainstorms increased from 4.5% to 13.3%, indicating that heavy rainstorms have become an increasing threat to agriculture in Northeast China over the last three decades. In total, at least 70% of cases of provincial yield losses in Northeast China over the last three decades could be attributed to climatic factors. The frequency of climate hazards has changed under global warming, resulting in new challenges for agriculture. While drought and low temperatures were the primary causes for climate-induced yield losses before the 1990s, negative impacts from extreme events, mainly drought but also heavy precipitation, have increased in the last three decades, associated with global change.

J,"Johnson, JC; Garver, E; Martin, T",Black widows on an urban heat island: extreme heat affects spider development and behaviour from egg to adulthood,"Urbanization rapidly alters the environment, often leading to decreased biodiversity. One abiotic selection pressure uniquely associated with urbanization is the urban heat island (UHI) effect-wherein built structures (e.g. paved surfaces) capture heat during the day, retain it through the dark cycle and result in significantly elevated night-time temperatures. Relatively few studies have asked what effects the UHI might have on the development and behaviour of urban animals, and even fewer have asked this question of urban arthropod pests who rely on external heat sources and can experience explosive urban population growth rates. In particular, behavioural plasticity is often cited as a critical phenotype for organisms to thrive after rapid environmental change such as urbanization. Here, the relationship between elevated urban temperatures and behaviour was examined in the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. With regard to the UHI, young spiderlings raised at urban, elevated temperatures showed significantly reduced life span, reduced body mass, elevated web building, heightened voracity towards heterospecific prey and sibling cannibalism. In contrast, males studied later in the final pre reproductive moults and raised at urban, elevated temperatures showed reduced life span, decreased adult body condition and increased voracity towards prey. We found no effects of temperature on late stage male web building or courtship behaviour. UHI temperatures simulated in the laboratory present black widow spiders with a myriad of developmental problems, but our data suggest these spiders use temperature-sensitive behavioural plasticity to attempt to accommodate this stressor.

Larvae enter a winter diapause induced by photoperiod in both native and invaded ranges, but factors that trigger the return to an active phase are still unknown. Yet, identifying them is crucial to understanding how diapause end synchronizes with the end of the winter stress encountered in Europe. We tested whether activity resumption is regulated by thermal and/or photoperiodic thresholds, two factors often involved in diapause termination, by exposing diapausing caterpillars from an invaded area to crossed treatments at the laboratory. The evolution of diapause rate was monitored over time and compared to that of nearby field sites invaded. A strong positive effect of increasing temperature was found on the rate and dynamics of diapause termination, whereas no compelling effect of photoperiod appeared. Resuming development directly when main stressors fade, not in response to indirect photoperiodic cues that could be mismatched outside native areas, likely contributes to the good match observed between diapause and the new climates encountered in the invaded range. This finding can improve phenological modelling of the overwintering generation and help better mitigate its damage.

To develop effective control technology, it is particularly necessary to study the basic biology and ecology of this invasive insect. This experiment investigated the development, survival, and reproduction and population growth of S. frugiperda on six cash crop species. This study indicated that S. frugiperda fed on maize and wheat had shorter preadult developmental durations, higher preadult survival, greater pupal weights and higher fecundity compared to the other four plants. Moreover, although the young larvae of S. frugiperda feeding on Chinese cabbage had a high mortality rate, the old larvae were voracious, which might still cause economic losses to Chinese cabbage. Our results showed that S. frugiperda could cause great economic losses to these cash crops, which should attract the attention of agricultural management departments. Spodoptera frugiperda is a significant migratory invasive pest, identified as a serious threat to agricultural production and food security in China.

This model uses specimen location data along with environmental data to produce habitat suitability estimates between 0 (low suitability) and 1 (high suitability). Model results indicate that the beetle should be able to establish throughout the range of most North American Liliaceae, including species of special conservation concern. With the increased utilization of habitat suitability models in conservation management, this model should be consulted, to help plan preemptive monitoring and control efforts forL. liliiin regions, with Liliaceae species of conservation concern. Invasive species are among the leading threats to global ecosystems due to impacts on native flora and fauna through competition and predation. The lily leaf beetle,Lilioceris liliiScopoli (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an invasive pest of lilies (Liliumspp.) and other genera of Liliaceae (Liliales). A habitat suitability model was created using Maxent, to help predict ifL. liliiwill be able to establish in locations were native North American Liliaceae species grow. The model was created using georeferenced occurrence records from the beetle's native, naturalized, and invasive range. Model results indicate that precipitation in the driest quarter and annual average temperatures are most strongly correlated withL. liliidistribution, and suggest that the species will perform poorly in very dry, hot, or cold environments. The model also indicates that the beetle should be able to establish throughout the range of most North American Liliaceae genera, including species of special conservation concern. This model can be used by natural area managers to identify areas of high habitat suitability that overlap with vulnerable North American Liliaceae species, and prioritizeL. liliimonitoring and control activities as the beetle continues to expand its range.",no,,,,,INSECTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,2075-4450,2020,10.3390/insects11090560,WOS:000580118900001

The majority of Drosophila fruit flies are not considered agricultural pests. However,D. suzukiiis a pest of several high-value soft and thin skin fruits such as strawberries and sweet cherries.Drosophila suzukiiis also considered worldwide as one of the most important invasive insect pests. We monitored the insect's flight and we assessed the infestation levels of different sweet-cherry cultivars, in coastal and mainland cherry orchards of Greece, for two consecutive years (2018-2020). Adults were captured throughout the year in the coastal area with two peaks in spring and late-autumn. Captures were nearly zero during the hot summer months. Trap captures exhibited only one peak in autumn at the mainland area, and ceased during winter and spring. Higher sweet-cherry infestation levels were recorded in the coastal than in the mainland area and in unmanaged than in commercial orchards. Both early and late-ripening cultivars were highly susceptible toD. suzukiiinfestation in the coastal area. Infestation rates were higher in late-ripening cultivars than in early-ripening ones in the mainland area. We conclude thatD. suzukiihas adapted well to the Mediterranean climate of Greece, and is able to progressively exploit several crops and wild hosts of mainland and coastal areas. Despite the recent invasion and wide spread ofDrosophila suzukiiMatsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in Europe, little is known regarding its population trends in coastal areas of the southern Mediterranean countries. Using adult trapping and fruit sampling, we studied the population dynamics ofD. suzukiiin coastal and mainland (semi-highland) cherry orchards of Greece, from 2018 to 2020. Adults were captured in traps baited with apple cider vinegar, placed in conventional and unmanaged sweet-cherry orchards, and in neighbouring wild growing hosts. Sampling of sweet-cherry fruit to assess infestation levels was conducted from early and late-ripening cherry cultivars in both areas. Adults were captured throughout the year in the coastal area with two peaks registered in spring and late-autumn. Captures were nearly zero during the hot summer months. Flight activity exhibited only one peak in autumn at the mainland area, and ceased during winter and spring. Captures in wild hosts were lower during the sweet-cherry ripening period than later in the season. Higher sweet-cherry infestation levels were recorded in the coastal than in the mainland area and in unmanaged than in commercial orchards. Both early and late-ripening cultivars were highly susceptible toD. suzukiiinfestation in the coastal area.

Development-delaying effects of controlled or modified atmospheres (MA) were strongest at 20 degrees C, followed by 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The shortest exposure time at which delay in development was statistically meaningful was 24 h. Development-delaying effects of both MAs were of similar pattern. When compared to control groups, delay in development was in the range of 2.03-9.64 d at 20 degrees C, 0.19-3.72 d at 25 degrees C, and 0.02-2.77 d at 30 degrees C. Cadra cautella pupae, which were exposed to 1% oxygen with 95% carbon dioxide (balance with nitrogen) at 20 degrees C for 64 h, could still hatch 24 d after the treatment in comparison to control groups in which pupal eclosion was max. 16 d. Therefore in MAs applications, delay in development could be an important issue to consider for controlling stored-products pests, especially at lower temperatures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Spreng, which is extremely harmful to this plant, and is also an important quarantine pest around the world. To understand the influence of climate factors on the distribution of this pest, maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) was used to predict the potential suitable distribution area under certain climatic conditions. The results showed that H. vitessoides was mainly located in the tropical and southern subtropical climate areas of China under current climatic conditions, with a total suitable distribution area of 107.48 x 10(4) km(2). The highly suitable areas were concentrated in the Pearl River Basin and the south of Lancang River Basin with area of 46.19 x 10(4) km(2). In the future, the suitable area showed a ten-dency to expand to the north. The total suitable distribution area of this species would reach 136.21 x 10(4)-151.62 x 10(4) km(2), which was 26.62%-40.65% higher than that of the current. The climatic factors of precipitation of warmest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter, min temperature of coldest month, and mean temperature of warmest quarter were the dominant variables affecting the distribution of H. vitessoides. It can be seen that the suitable area of this pest is relatively large and tends to expand, which poses a threat to the growth of A. sinensis. It is suggested that the relevant afforestation and phytosanitary departments should attach great importance and take necessary measures to control the spread of this pest. (c) 2020 The Authors.

The highly polyphagous brown marmorated stinkbug,Halyomorpha halysStal (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is native to East Asia and invasive in Europe and North America, damaging a wide variety of fruit and vegetable crops. In Switzerland, crop damage and increasing populations have been observed since 2017 and related to increasing temperatures. We studied the climatic suitability, population growth, and the number of generations under present and future climate conditions forH. halysin Switzerland, using a modified version of the bioclimatic model package CLIMEX. To address the high topographic variability in Switzerland, model simulations were based on climate data of high spatial resolution (approx. 2 km), which significantly increased their explanatory power, and identified many more climatically suitable areas in comparison to previous models. The validation of the CLIMEX model using observational records collected in a citizen science initiative between 2004 and 2019 revealed that more than 15 years after its accidental introduction,H. halyshas colonised nearly all bioclimatic suitable areas in Switzerland and there is limited potential for range expansion into new areas under present climate conditions. Simulations with climate change scenarios suggest an extensive range expansion into higher altitudes, an increase in generations per year, an earlier start ofH. halysactivity in spring and a prolonged period for nymphs to complete development in autumn. A permanent shift from one to two generations per year and the associated population growth ofH. halysmay result in increasing crop damages in Switzerland.

Here, we use a population genomic approach to investigate evolutionary processes in the two most dominant spider mites in China,Tetranychus truncatusEhara andTetranychus pueraricolaEhara et Gotoh, which have wide distributions, short generation times, and large population sizes. We generated genome resequencing of 246 spider mites mostly from China, as well as Japan and Canada at a combined total depth of 3,133x. Based on demographic reconstruction, we found that both mite species likely originated from refugia in southwestern China and then spread to other regions, with the dominantT. truncatusspreading similar to 3,000 years later thanT. pueraricola. Estimated changes in population sizes of the pests matched known periods of glaciation and reinforce the recent expansion of the dominant spider mites.T. truncatusshowed a greater extent of local adaptation with more genes (76 vs. 17) associated with precipitation, including candidates involved in regulation of homeostasis of water and ions, signal transduction, and motor skills. In both species, many genes (135 inT. truncatusand 95 inT. pueraricola) also showed signatures of selection related to elevation, including G-protein-coupled receptors, cytochrome P450s, and ABC-transporters.

It is one of the most important cereal pests. In Brazil, the economic losses associated with this aphid result mainly from the transmission of the barley yellow dwarf viruses. Decision-making for the adoption of management measures must consider the initial population size, the potential for population increase, and the time when this population will reach levels at which the resulting damage is equal to the costs of control measures. Consequently, the establishment of management programmes and decision support systems should be based on models that estimate the potential population growth of this pest species. Temperature is one of the main factors that determine the growth rate of insect populations. Generally, controlled experiments are designed to examine the relationship of temperature at fixed intervals in relation to the development phases of insects. In nature, thermal regimes are not constant, and population growth is the result of a series of combined events. In this work, the effects of different thermal regimes on the population growth ofR. padiwere compared. An agent-based model was used to estimate population growth, and the parameters defined in controlled regimes were compared with fluctuating temperatures under natural conditions.

Diapause allowsin situadaptation to adverse environmental conditions, providing sufficient parent propagules for insect pest proliferation when optimal conditions resurface. This phenomenon has however not been observed in the invasive South American tomato pinwormTuta absolutain its Mediterranean invaded areas. Moreover, no studies have looked at its overwintering survival in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we thus investigated the cold hardiness ofTuta absolutalarvae and adults to better explain its local overwintering adaptation strategy. RESULTS Larval lower lethal temperatures ranged from -1 to -17 degrees C for 0.5 to 4 h durations. Adults showed lower temperature activity limits than larvae albeit freeze strategy experiments showed neither survived internal freezing. Fasting and dehydration pre-treatment generally depressed SCPs, although asymmetrically, conferring more negative SCPs for larvae. Ramping rates, synonymic to diurnal temperature changes also significantly affected SCPs while, inoculative freezing significantly compromised freezing temperatures in both larvae and adults. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that (i)Tuta absolutalarvae and adults are chill-susceptible and may successfully overwinter, (ii) larvae appear more cold hardy than adults and (iii) ecological factors e.g.inoculative freezing, cooling rates, feeding- and hydration-status may affect cold hardiness.

However, living organisms rarely experience these conditions in real field situations. Understanding the impact of pesticides on non-target beneficial arthropods under temperature stresses is especially important in terms of global warming. We assessed the lethal and sublethal effects of four modern insecticides (chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, spinetoram, spinosad), on the generalist predatorMacrolophus pygmaeus (Hemiptera: Miridae) under a range of temperatures (from 10 to 40 degrees C) frequently experienced in a real field scenario. A reduction coefficient (E-x) was calculated by summarizing the mortality and predator reproductive capacity and, the chemicals were classified according to the International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC) toxicity classes. The insecticides showed a marked synergistic effect with temperature, as the predator mortality and reproductive outputs were significantly correlated with increasing temperatures. Spinosyns interacted significantly with temperature causing the highest mortality and lowest fertility rates. Anthranilic diamides showed a safer ecotoxicological profile compared to spinosyns, with cyantraniliprole being more harmful than chlorantraniliprole.

Correlation analysis showed that, the maximum temperature had a significant influence on aphid population specifically on kale crop (r = 0.676, p = 0.032). Although, the relative humidity, minimum and average temperature, rainfall and wind speed has shown none significant correlation with aphid population growth. There was variation in aphid population, crop preference and infestation peak in relation to weather factors. In general, during the experiment higher aphid population was observed on kale crop when the maximum temperature and relative humidity were < 26.75(0)C and 72%, respectively. This study provided information on time of initial infestation and also the peak activity of the particular insect in relation to temperature.

Most insect pest populations are strongly regulated by abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation, and assessing relationships between abiotic conditions and pest dynamics can aid decision-making. However, many pests are also managed with insecticides, which can confound relationships between abiotic factors and pest dynamics. Here we used data from a regional monitoring network in the Pacific Northwest United States to explore effects of abiotic factors on populations of an intensively managed potato pest, the potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli Sulc), which can vector Candidatus Liberibacter psyllaurus, a bacterial pathogen of potatoes. We assessed effects of temperature on psyllid populations, and show psyllid population growth followed predictable patterns within each year, but there was considerable variation across years in psyllid abundance. Examination of seasonal weather patterns suggested that in 2017, when psyllid populations were less abundant by several orders of magnitude than other years, a particularly long and cold period of winter weather may have harmed overwintering populations and limited population growth. The rate of degree-day accumulation over time, as well as total degree-day accumulation also affected trap catch abundance, likely by mediating the number of psyllid generations per season. Our findings indicate that growers can reliably infer the potential magnitude of risk from potato psyllids using monitoring data, date of first detection, seasonal weather patterns, and population size early in the growing season.",yes,field,abundance,,,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0046-225X,1938-2936,2020,10.1093/ee/nvaa068,WOS:000581004700025

To find potential biocontrol agents of B. hilaris, three egg parasitoids were imported from Pakistan, including Ooencyrtus mirus, a recently described uniparental species. We investigated the effect of temperature on survival and developmental rate in O. mirus from egg to adult. At 14 and 16 degrees C, no adults emerged unless the immatures were transferred later to a warmer temperature. At constant 18 degrees C, a low percentage emerged, but again more emerged if the immatures were transferred to a warmer temperature. Survival ranged from 80 to 96% at 20-37 degrees C and did not differ significantly among these temperatures. No adults emerged at 38 degrees C. Regardless of the amount of time the parasitized eggs were held at 14 and 16 degrees C, the developmental times after returning the eggs to 26 degrees C were similar, suggesting a quiescence process rather than simply slow development. At higher temperatures, the developmental rate increased linearly from 18 to 36 degrees C and then declined at 37 degrees C. The Wang model provided the best fit of the data and estimated a lower developmental threshold at 13.0 degrees C, an optimal temperature at 35.6 degrees C, and an upper developmental threshold of 38.3 degrees C. The thermal constant for total immature development is 168.4 degree-days.

Currently, N. simulans in soybean is predominantly found in Argentina, but future changes in the distribution from both dispersal and range shifts due to climate change may affect soybean cultivation in southern South America. We developed a species distribution model to examine the distribution range of N. simulans. We compared the potential distribution of N. simulans under current and future projected climatic conditions in order to identify future areas of natural occurrence with ecological niche models using Maxent. Current records of N. simulans show that while the species is present in Argentina, and some areas of Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, our models suggest that many new suitable areas will be available for N. simulans under climate change including other regions of Argentina, and southern Chile. Our results also predict potential future range shifts and distributions into Bolivia, but not Peru nor Brazil. In our model, seasonal trends in temperature were shown to have the greatest contribution to the potential distribution, whereas isothermality (i.e., temperature variability) was correlated to potential future distribution ranges.

Measuring larval survival inside stems from egg hatch through diapause-mediated dormancy is a potential measure of population size for the next year but is also useful in assessing effects of growing season precipitation and temperature. Larval growth is synchronized with host plant growth, and the larva cannot switch hosts. Thus, incorporating plant physiological time, as growing degree days (GDD), may yield a better prediction of larval survival. Therefore, we assessed wheat stem sawfly survival from early larval growth to the beginning of autumnal diapause in barley cultivars selected from across feed, forage, and two- or six-row malt groups. Field experiments were conducted in Gallatin and Chouteau counties, Montana, in 2016 and 2017. We used Kaplan-Meier estimation to assess larval survival among cultivars. We found that the survival of pre-diapause larvae was greatest in 'Hockett' (36.5%) and lowest in 'Celebration' (15.4%). Precipitation and temperature during the growing season affected temporal patterns for larval survival across study sites. Adjusting survivorship curves using site-specific GDD accumulation allowed cultivar-specific survivorship to be estimated more precisely for each site, despite differing environmental influences. Our findings suggest that measuring wheat stem sawfly survival across barley cultivars and standardizing by site-specific GDDs may provide better recommendations on barley cultivars that impede wheat stem sawfly population growth and reduce economic losses.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-0493,1938-291X,2020,10.1093/jee/toaa097,WOS:000574402100048

Our results indicated that higher and lower temperatures caused a steeper decline in survivorship. The highest survival rate was observed at 25 and 27 degrees C. The mean total development time was significantly decreased with increasing the temperatures; while adult longevity for both female and males significantly decreased. Furthermore, offspring production did not occur at 35 degrees C.

Our results show that combined elevated CO(2)and temperature increased plant growth, biomass, and carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio, which in turn significantly decreased aphid fecundity and development time. However, virus infection reduced chlorophyll content, biomass, wheat growth and C:N ratio, significantly increasedR. padifecundity and development time. Regardless of virus infection, aphid growth rates remained unchanged under simulated future conditions. Therefore, asR. padiis currently a principal pest in temperate cereal crops worldwide, mainly due to its role as a plant virus vector, it will likely continue to have significant economic importance. Furthermore, an earlier and more distinct virus symptomatology was highlighted under the future predicted scenario, with consequences on virus transmission, disease epidemiology and, thus, wheat yield and quality.

UsingFrankliniella fuscaas a thrips species of focus, we empirically developed a composite model of thrips phenology and cotton seedling susceptibility to predict site-specific infestation risk so that monitoring and other resources can be allocated efficiently, to optimize the timing of thrips control measures to maximize effectiveness, and to inform stakeholders about the dynamics of thrips infestation and cotton seedling injury at a time when thrips are evolving resistance to commonly-used pesticides. Results A mixture distribution model of thrips infestation potential, fit to data describingF. fuscaadult dispersal in time, proved best for predicting infestations ofF. fuscaon cotton seedlings.

Temperature is an important abiotic factor that influences insect population dynamics and distribution by affecting their survival, development, and reproduction. We examined the fecundity, pre-oviposition and oviposition periods, and longevity of adult B. dorsalis at various constant temperatures ranging from 13 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The longevity of female B. dorsalis ranged from 116.8 days (18.8 degrees C) to 22.4 days (34.9 degrees C), and the maximum fecundity per female was 1,684 eggs at 28.1 degrees C. Females were only able to lay eggs at 16.7 degrees C to 34.9 degrees C, and both the pre-oviposition and oviposition periods were different depending on the temperature. We modeled female reproduction in two oviposition models (OMs): 1) the current model developed by Kim and Lee, an OM composed of a fecundity model, age-specific survival model, and age-specific cumulative oviposition rate model, and 2) a two-phase OM modified the logic structure of the current model by separating pre-oviposition, so that oviposition was estimated with the female in oviposition phase who had complete pre-oviposition phase. The results of the two-phase OM provided more realistic outputs at lower and higher temperatures than those of the current model.

Moreover. population fluctuation of S. smirnovi and its predator. Scolothrips longicornis Priesner, were studied on almond (Mamaei c.v.) under field conditions (from April to October) during two successive years 2008-2009. Laboratory results showed that egg incubation period is the longest (3.25 +/- 0.25 and 3.05 +/- 0.25 days for female and male, respectively) in the immature stage. In addition, the female total immature period (2.91 +/- 0.43 days) is longer than the male (2.87 +/- 0.64 days). Female and male longevity were calculated as 13.20 +/- 1.10 and 9.25 +/- 0.75 days, respectively. Mean fecundity of the mite was calculated as 58.13 +/- 6.60 eggs/female. Field studies showed that the mite overwintered as eggs around the buds of almond shoots. Overwintering eggs hatched depending on the climate conditions from the third decade of March (in 2008) to the third decade of April (in 2009). In both years, mite population continuously increased and reached to a maximum density during June and July.

J,"Teder, T",Phenological responses to climate warming in temperate moths and butterflies: species traits predict future changes in voltinism,"Changes in the number of generations per year (voltinism) have been among the most common phenological responses to climate warming in insects inhabiting seasonal environments. Nevertheless, numerous species have maintained univoltine (one generation per year) phenology with increasing temperatures, indicating the involvement of phylogenetic, ecological or some other constraints on phenological change. I examined geographic variation in voltinism in moths and butterflies of northern Europe to identify species traits that might predispose species to univoltine/multivoltine phenology. I focused on species with a wide latitudinal distribution range (15 degrees as a minimum) which makes it unlikely that constraints imposed by season length could preclude multivoltinism across their distribution. Almost half of the 731 moth and butterfly species considered appear to have a single generation throughout their entire European range. A univoltine life-cycle across a wide latitudinal gradient suggests the presence of some constraint that makes additional generations either impossible or at least strongly disadvantageous, which will unlikely change with future climate warming. The scattered distribution of univoltine and multivoltine species across the lepidopteran phylogeny indicates that phylogenetic constraints do not strongly limit changes in voltinism, and the trait is open to ecologically-driven adaptive evolution. My data show that species with one generation per year are generally larger than multivoltine species, but size forms no absolute constraint to having multiple generations per year. Obligately univoltine species dominate among egg and adult overwinterers (life-histories typical of so-called spring-feeders), whereas species with capacity for multiple generations prevail among pupal overwinterers. Multivoltinism is also infrequent among species feeding on grasses, particularly in endophagous grass-feeders. Larval diet breadth has no discernible effect on voltinism. Given the diverse ecological consequences of voltinism and its changes, accounting for the species' capacity for multivoltinism may be a key to address future challenges in biodiversity conservation and pest management.",no,,,,,OIKOS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0030-1299,1600-0706,2020,10.1111/oik.07119,WOS:000544487100009

A review of previous studies suggests that the two species have similar temperature tolerances and similar temperature thresholds for development. However, the distribution and seasonality of WBPH suggest that its temperature optima for performance (survival, oviposition and growth) may be lower than for BPH. We compared adult longevity, oviposition, nymph survival and development success, as well as nymph biomass in both species across a gradient of constant temperatures from 15 degrees C-40 degrees C, at 5 degrees C intervals. The most suitable temperatures for oviposition, nymph biomass and development success were 5-10 degrees C lower for WBPH than for BPH. Furthermore, compared to BPH, WBPH demonstrated clear differences in oviposition on different rice subspecies and on rice at different growth stages at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, but not at other temperatures.

Tomato fruits were provided as an alternative food source. We demonstrated that Gryllidae spp. were able to feed on young cabbage, and that the damage level increased with temperature when no alternative food was available.

Flight activity for both males and females combined started near dawn and generally increased to a single broad activity peak during mid to late morning. Male flight activity peaked earlier than female flight activity and this separation in peak activity widened as mean daytime temperature increased. Flight activity for both sexes increased rapidly during early morning in response to the combined effects of increasing light intensity and temperature, with decreasing flight activity late in the day as temperature decreased. During midday, flight activity was slightly negatively associated with light intensity and temperature.

Our study focused on three morphological traits (body size, wing shape, and fluctuating asymmetry) in Q-fly samples collected from 1955 to 1965. We assessed how these traits vary by sex, and in response to latitude, environmental variables, and geographic distance. First, we found sexual dimorphism in body size and wing shape, but not in fluctuating asymmetry. Females had a larger body size but shorter and wider wings than males, which may be due to reproductive and/or locomotion differences between females and males. Secondly, the body size of Q-flies varied with latitude, which conforms to Bergmann's rule. Finally, we found Q-fly wing shape was more closely related to temperature rather than aridity, and low temperature and high aridity may lead to high asymmetry in Q-fly populations.",no,,,,,INSECTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,2075-4450,2020,10.3390/insects11060390,WOS:000551265500001

Thus, temperature has potentially important implications for host plant resistance. Because temperature directly impacts arthropod pests, both positively and negatively, distinguishing direct effects from indirect effects mediated through host plants poses a challenge for researchers and practitioners.

In this study, the performance of Spodoptera litura was analyzed to observe the effects of high temperatures on chemical-based defense in plants in the context of insect-plant interaction. Results show that high temperature reduced the nutritional value and content of defense compounds in the foliage of yellow cress (Rorippa dubia). These alterations negatively affected the performance of second instar S. litura larvae feeding on plants grown at high temperature. Low quality of the food source is likely the key cause of slow development of larvae. Adaptation of herbivorous insects known as compensatory feeding is projected resulting in more crop losses under global warming.

Commercially available adult parasitoids were provided with 1) food and D. suzukii pupae; 2) food and no D. suzukii pupae; 3) no food and no pupae. The results show that adult females of T. drosophilae lived longer than males, and both generally benefitted from food supply. The highest level of survival was observed between 8 and 12 degrees C for fed insects, irrespective of whether they were offered host pupae or not. The absence of food led to the highest mortality, but the parasitoid demonstrated considerably resistance to prolonged starvation.

In nature, pests face multiple overlapping environmental stressors, which may significantly influence survival. To cope with rapidly changing environments, insects often employ a suite of mechanisms at both acute and chronic time-scales, thereby improving fitness at sub-optimal thermal environments. For T. absoluta, physiological responses to transient thermal variability remain under explored. Moreso, environmental effects and physiological responses may differ across insect life stages and this can have implications for population dynamics. Against this background, we investigated short and long term plastic responses to temperature of T. absoluta larvae (4th instar) and adults (24-48 h old) from field populations. We measured traits of temperature tolerance vis critical thermal limits [critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax)], heat knockdown time (HKDT), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and supercooling points (SCP). Our results showed that at the larval stage, Rapid Cold Hardening (RCH) significantly improved CTmin and HKDT but impaired SCP and CCRT. Heat hardening in larvae impaired CTmin, CCRT, SCP, CTmax but not HKDT. In adults, both heat and cold hardening generally impaired CTmin and CTmax, but had no effects on HKDT, SCP and CCRT. Low temperature acclimation significantly improved CTmin and HKDT while marginally compromising CCRT and CTmax, whereas high temperature acclimation had no significant effects on any traits except for HKDT in larvae. Similarly, low and high temperature acclimation had no effects on CTmin, SCPs and CTmax, while high temperature acclimation significantly compromised adult CCRT.

The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is one of the world's most devastating pests. Although originally from the Americas, this insect has become a global food security threat. The reason is that its polyphagia and adaptability combine with the effects of climate change. In Costa Rica, the species of the Spodoptera order, are considered minor pests in sugarcane production. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap in population dynamics of the moths of this genus. Objective. Monitor the populations of S. frugiperda, S. sunia, and S. exigua species in a sugarcane field. Materials and methods. The study was conducted in a sugarcane plantation of the variety CC 01-1940, located in Guanacaste, Costa Rica between February 2018 and May 2019. Sexual pheromone-baited traps formulated for S. frugiperda, S. sunia, and S. exigua were used, each pheromone corresponded to a treatment and ten replicates of each one were established. The abundance of each species was compared and correlated with several climatological variables. Results. The highest percentage of catches corresponded to S. frugiperda, followed by S. sunia, while the captures of S. exigua were marginal. For both S. frugiperda and S. sunia, the dry season months favored larger populations, so factors such as higher average temperature, thermal amplitude, and lower relative humidity were associated with higher captures in the traps.

There is insufficient understanding of the precise time windows during which inter-annual variation in weather drives phenological shifts and the consequences for mismatches between interacting species and resultant population dynamics-particularly for insects. We use a 20 year study on a tri-trophic system: sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, two associated aphid species Drepanosiphum platanoidis and Periphyllus testudinaceus and their hymenopteran parasitoids. Using a sliding window approach, we assess climatic drivers of phenology in all three trophic levels. We quantify the magnitude of resultant trophic mismatches between aphids and their plant hosts and parasitoids, and then model the impacts of these mismatches, direct weather effects and density dependence on local-scale aphid population dynamics. Warmer temperatures in mid-March to late-April were associated with advanced sycamore budburst, parasitoid attack and (marginally) D. platanoidis emergence. The precise time window during which spring weather advances phenology varies considerably across each species. Crucially, warmer temperatures in late winter delayed the emergence of both aphid species. Seasonal variation in warming rates thus generates marked shifts in the relative timing of spring events across trophic levels and mismatches in the phenology of interacting species. Despite this, we found no evidence that aphid population growth rates were adversely impacted by the magnitude of mismatch with their host plants or parasitoids, or direct impacts of temperature and precipitation. Strong density dependence effects occurred in both aphid species and probably buffered populations, through density-dependent compensation, from adverse impacts of the marked inter-annual climatic variation that occurred during the study period. These findings explain the resilience of aphid populations to climate change and uncover a key mechanism, warmer winter temperatures delaying insect phenology, by which climate change drives asynchronous shifts between interacting species.",yes,field,abundance,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,1365-2486,2020,10.1111/gcb.15015,WOS:000526102300009

Then, a second experiment evaluated the infectivity and recycling capacity of these EPNs on L4 and L6 larvae and pupae of A. deprivata at 16, 22, and 28 degrees C for six days. While mortality of pupae reached 62.5 +/- 20.2%, in larvae, this value was 100%, regardless of temperature. At 28 degrees C, despite the high level of mortality in larvae, EPNs could not emerge from the cadaver in White traps.

Also, a G. mellonella larva inside a perforated Eppendorf vial containing soil was buried 5 cm deep. After 6 days, damage on the plants by A. deprivata and survival of insects were evaluated. The mortality level of the cutworm when IJs were applied in an aqueous suspension was equivalent to that on the treatment with the synthetic insecticide. When applied within the cadaver, mortality level was equivalent to that caused by both commercial insecticides; however, the death of larvae took longer than when applied in any of the aqueous suspensions.

This pest belongs to univoltine species and tends to estivate and overwinter in high altitudes of nearby mountains as diapausing adults. The economic importance of the crop was attacked by this pest, i.e., wheat led the authors to study the physiological adaptations of these diapausing adults, that is, changes in the supercooling point (SCP), in the accumulation of cryoprotectants, and in the activities of the related enzymes in relation to diapause development. The mean SCP of the diapausing adults was found to be -8 degrees C. The lowest SCP, i.e., approximately -11 degrees C, was observed in the middle of diapause, October, when the highest cold hardiness was also interestingly recorded. This finding proposed that SCP depression could be a feasible cold-tolerance strategy for diapausing adults. The sugar content was high in the initiation and at the termination of diapause and was low during diapause maintenance. These sugar reserves were most likely utilized to be converted to glycogen and lipid during diapause maintenance as a survival strategy. The changes in the glycogen and lipid contents were inversely proportional to the changes in the total sugar content. The authors also found that the changes in the glycogen content were directly proportional to those in the low-molecular-weight carbohydrates (e.g., glycerol and trehalose) and in the diapause development. This finding underlined the role of the low-molecular-weight carbohydrates, such as the cryoprotectants, in enhancing the cold tolerance of the given insect. In this study, the diapause-associated changes in the activities of alpha-amylases and proteases were also investigated. The results showed that the enzyme activities were related to diapause development and cold-tolerance enhancement. The highest enzyme activity was observed in September.

Abundance and population dynamics of leaf webworm and its parasitoids were studied in oil plantations in Andhra Pradesh, India. Pest density (number of larvae / leaf) and parasitism rates of parasitoids were quantified. Influences of weather factors viz., maximum and minimum temperature, morning and evening relative humidity and rainfall on the abundance of leaf webworm and its parasitoids were assessed. A female moth laid about 101.60 eggs in its life time. The caterpillars developed through six to seven instars. Total life cycle completed in 32.9 days (egg to adult). Leaf webworm preferred to defoliate the older and intermediate leaves of the palms. Early stage caterpillars of feed on green parenchymatous tissues of the leaflets from under surface leaving a thin parchment like upper epidermis undamaged, while, the later stages defoliate the leaves. In severe cases, leaflets appear widely eroded, thus curling, bending and drying consequently to the pest infestation. The activity of the pest in oil palm plantations was limited to cooler months of the year i.e. October to March.

Females showed a short pre-oviposition period while the period of oviposition lasted about three weeks, with a rate of 24.2 eggs/day. Each female laid an average of 587.5 eggs and spawned the largest amount of eggs during the first week after emergence. Fed males live up to 62 days at 20 degrees C while fed females about 63 days at 25 degrees C. These results are crucial to draw up a multi-facet IPM approach against A. bungii in the outbreak areas.",no,,,,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2045-2322,NA,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-63959-9,WOS:000560712400013

Our study establishes both a predictive generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), and a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) of the dynamic seasonal phenology of D. suzukii based on four years of adult monitoring trap data in Wisconsin tart cherry orchards collected throughout the growing season. The models incorporate year, field site, relative humidity, and degree days (DD); and relate these factors to trap catch. The GLMM estimated a coefficient of 2.21 for DD/1000, meaning for every increment of 1000 DD, trap catch increases by roughly 9 flies. The GAMM generated a curve based on a cubic regression smoothing function of DD which approximates critical DD points of first adult D. suzukii detection at 1276 DD, above average field populations beginning at 2019 DD, and peak activity at 3180 DD. By incorporating four years of comprehensive seasonal phenology data from the same locations, we introduce robust models capable of using DD to forecast changing adult D. suzukii populations in the field leading to the application of more timely and effective management strategies.",no,,,,,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1932-6203,NA,2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0227726,WOS:000536647300005

Costs of large-scale rearing and storage are among the major obstacles limiting the use of other insect species for pollination services. Recently, the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) has been identified as a potential alternative to the honeybee; development of storage techniques for this species would significantly improve its commercial viability as a managed pollinator. In this study, we investigated the effects of diapause and cold storage on L. sericata for mass rearing. We found that diapausing larvae could be stored at 7.5 degrees C for several months with low mortality. The effects of cold storage on adult emergence depended on the strain of the fly tested. Adult survival was comparable between directly developing flies and flies that underwent diapause and cold storage until day 15 post-emergence. Adult locomotor activity (essential for effective pollination) was comparable between direct development and cold storage treatments.

J,"Ward, SF; Fei, SL; Liebhold, AM",Temporal dynamics and drivers of landscape-level spread by emerald ash borer,"Non-native insects pose threats to forest health and often spread via stratified dispersal in which long-distance jumps cause elevated rates of range expansion. Quantifying patterns and developing models of spread are central to understanding drivers of invasion and forecasting future invasions. We investigated the utility of models for characterizing and predicting spread of emerald ash borer (EAB), quantified temporal dynamics of spread and identified correlates of county-level invasion risk. We estimated rates and frequency of EAB spread and length of long-distance jumps throughout the contiguous USA from 1997 to 2018 and compared observed patterns with model predictions. A time-to-event model was then developed at the county level to assess the influence of habitat characteristics and propagule pressure on invasion risk. The final model was used to forecast invasion risk across the contiguous USA. Range expansion by EAB accorded well with model predictions. Following the initial establishment phase, range expansion rates were biphasic, shifting to a faster, linear pattern around 2002 and then declining from 2015 onwards. From 2003 onwards, EAB invaded 6-134 new counties per year, including a mean of 14 discrete jumps per year averaging 93 +/- 7 SE km. Risk of spread was positively associated with proximity to previously invaded areas, human population density and densities of ash and non-ash trees in rural forests but negatively associated with temperature. Synthesis and applications. At the regional level, the invasion by emerald ash borer appears to be entering the saturation phase, indicating that most high-risk counties in the eastern USA have been invaded. Even though spread has recently slowed, counties in close proximity to invaded areas and that have high densities of humans and trees are at the greatest risk of becoming invaded.

In recent years, with the onset of global climate change and the accompanying increase in the greenhouse effect, elevated climatic temperatures have become one of the main environmental factors affecting growth and reproduction in insects, and the optimal developmental temperature of B. tau was found to be from 25 degrees C to 31 degrees C, the growth, development and reproduction of B. tau are normal under the optimal temperature conditions. In order to determine the repercussions that elevated temperature have on B. tau, we assessed the effects that short-term (12h) high-temperature exposures (34 degrees C, 36 degrees C, 38 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 42 degrees C, 44 degrees C, 46 degrees C, and 48 degrees C) had on the growth, development and reproduction of B. tau at different developmental stages of the fly. The results showed that the survival rate of B. tau gradually decreased in all stages following exposure to short-term high-temperatures. The pupal stage was the least sensitive to increased temperatures. The pupae withstood the highest lethal temperature, having an LT50 of 42.060 degrees C, followed by female adults (40.447 degrees C), male adults (40.013 degrees C), and larvae (36.740 degrees C).

J,"Nachman, G; Skovgard, H",Modeling the Influence of Ambient Temperature on the Interactions Between the Stable Fly (Diptera: Muscidae) and Its Natural Enemy Spalangia cameroni (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) to Assess Consequences of Climate Change,"A simulation model was used to predict how temperature influences biological control of stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans (L.)) by the pupal parasitoid Spalangia cameroni. Temperature, which was either constant or fluctuated due to seasonal variation and/or environmental stochasticity, was modeled as a first order autocorrelation process. The simulations showed that stable flies could tolerate a wider temperature interval than expected from their thermal performance curve (TPC). This was attributed to the fact that immature flies develop in manure, which protects them against low air temperatures. In contrast, the parasitoids were found to have a narrower thermal tolerance range than expected from their TPC. This was attributed to the temperature-dependent functional response of S. cameroni, which was a limiting factor for the parasitoid's development and survival when host densities were low at suboptimal temperatures. The effects of seasonal variation on critical thermal limits were studied by means of thermal performance diagrams (TPDs). Fluctuating temperatures narrowed the thermal tolerance range of both species. At constant temperatures, the simulations showed that the optimal temperature for using S. cameroni in control of stable flies is similar to 20 degrees C and that the parasitoid can persist in environments with yearly average temperatures between 18 and 29 degrees C. However, if temperature variation was taken into consideration, it changed both the optimal temperature and the temperature interval at which biological control will be possible.

Depletion was most pronounced after a period of cold weather, and around the peak swarming period. Depletion observed for A. lineatus was not statistically significant.

While T. planipennisi appears to be persisting where it has been introduced in northern United States, S. agrili failed to establish in northeastern states. The more recently identified parasitoid S. galinae was recovered from the Russian Far East and climate matching suggests it should be suited for release in colder climates. We collected data on the phenology of EAB and its introduced larval parasitoids from colonies established in an insectary, growth chambers, and field-caged trees in Syracuse, New York to determine whether asynchrony between parasitoids and EAB or climate could impact establishment and persistence. Phenological data indicated EAB has one and 2-yr life cycles in NewYork, with parasitoid-susceptible EAB larvae available spring to fall for parasitism.

Ex Lam. Urb.), an economic pillar of the wood industry in Ecuador. Commercial balsa plantations have been expanded from humid to dry climate areas to limit insect damage, but basic knowledge is still lacking on the interaction of C. ochromactonus activity with variation in climate and plantation age. We investigated the effects of climate and host age on the seasonal flight activity of C. ochromactonus and its infestation rate and intensity, as well as the effect of age and individual infestation intensity on balsa dieback. Experiments were conducted in 1-, 2-, and 3-yr-old commercial balsa plantations located in areas of humid or dry climates. Seasonal flight activity (monitored with baited traps) differed between study sites and seasons. Increased flight activity was significantly correlated with higher relative humidity, higher mean temperature, and reduced precipitation during the dry season in the humid site and with increased mean and minimum temperature and increased precipitation during the rainy season in the dry site. Infestation rates by C. ochromactonus significantly increased with plantation age, especially in the humid site. Intensity of individual infestations (measured as number of successful insect entry holes per tree) was significantly influenced by both climate and plantation age, and it was particularly severe on 3-yr-old trees in the dry site. Percentage of foliage loss significantly increased with infestation intensity.

Our study assessed larval emergence from cowpea pods in the summer to fall growing seasons, egg development in female adults over the first (summer) and second (fall) generations, and adult emergence from infested soil after the first and second generations. There was a clear reduction in larval emergence from summer to fall. Egg and follicle development in female C. aeneus dropped off dramatically by September of each year. There was an extended emergence pattern of weevil adults from the soil in the fall as compared to the summer generation.

Sitona lineatus populations are monitored in spring by assessing adult-induced feeding damage. We assume the quantity of feeding damage is indicative of population density. However, the effects of abiotic factors, including temperature, on feeding rate are not known. We assessed the effects of temperature, population density, and sex on S. lineatus feeding rate by counting feeding notches on host plants exposed to adult weevils for 24 hours at four densities and under five temperature regimes. Individual females consumed more than male weevils. As expected, feeding damage increased with weevil density. The influence of temperature increased as weevil densities increased. Feeding rate did not differ between constant and fluctuating temperature regimes of equal mean daily temperature.

J,"Enriquez, T; Ruel, D; Charrier, M; Colinet, H",Effects of fluctuating thermal regimes on cold survival and life history traits of the spotted wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii),"Drosophila suzukii is an invasive pest causing severe damages to a large panel of cultivated crops. To facilitate its biocontrol with strategies such as sterile or incompatible insect techniques, D. suzukii must be mass-produced and then stored and transported under low temperature. Prolonged cold exposure induces chill injuries that can be mitigated if the cold period is interrupted with short warming intervals, referred to as fluctuating thermal regimes (FTR). In this study, we tested how to optimally use FTR to extend the shelf life of D. suzukii under cold storage. Several FTR parameters were assessed: temperature (15, 20, 25 degrees C), duration (0.5, 1, 2, 3 h), and frequency (every 12, 24, 36, 48 h) of warming intervals, in two wild-type lines and in two developmental stages (pupae and adults). Generally, FTR improved cold storage tolerance with respect to constant low temperatures (CLT). Cold mortality was lower when recovery temperature was 20 degrees C or higher, when duration was 2 h per day or longer, and when warming interruptions occurred frequently (every 12 or 24 h). Applying an optimized FTR protocol to adults greatly reduced cold mortality over long-term storage (up to 130 d). Consequences of FTR on fitness-related traits were also investigated. For adults, poststorage survival was unaffected by FTR, as was the case for female fecundity and male mating capacity. On the other hand, when cold storage occurred at pupal stage, poststorage survival and male mating capacity were altered under CLT, but not under FTR. After storage of pupae, female fecundity was lower under FTR compared to CLT, suggesting an energy trade-off between repair of chill damages and egg production.

Experiments were conducted on field-collected larvae and laboratory-reared F-1 larval offspring from each of the two host species. Our results showed significant host plant effects on both cold and heat tolerance. Insects from sweet sorghum showed higher thermal resilience (cold and heat) relative to those from maize as indicated by their low lower thermal activity limits (0.73 and 0.02 degrees C magnitude, respectively) and high upper thermal activity limits (0.5 and 0.28 degrees C magnitude, respectively). Both field and F-1 larval populations from sweet sorghum recovered faster from chill coma and also took longer to be knocked down by acute heat stress, further affirming their superior thermal tolerance to those that fed on maize. These results therefore indicate that host plant species may potentially mediate thermal fitness of C. partellus.

From the thirteenth century, kumara cultivation occurred along the coastlines in the warmer regions of New Zealand where its associated pests were controlled by traditional methods. In 1952, an observation was made indicating that Wiseana, an endemic genera of ghost moths, possibly fed on kumara.

J,"Egerer, M; Liere, H; Lucatero, A; Philpott, SM",Plant damage in urban agroecosystems varies with local and landscape factors,"Biotic and abiotic factors at local to landscape scales influence insect pest and disease dynamics in agricultural systems. However, relative to studies focused on the importance of these drivers of crop plant damage in rural agricultural systems, few studies investigate plant damage from herbivore insects and plant diseases in urban agroecosystems, and consequently, most urban farmers lack knowledge on crop protection tactics. Here we use three common crop species within urban agroecosystems (community gardens) distributed across an urban landscape as a model system to ask how local, landscape, and microclimate factors relate to herbivore and disease plant damage. We hypothesized that plant damage would be lower in gardens with greater local vegetation complexity, landscape-scale complexity, and less variable temperatures, but that the importance of factors is species- and damage-specific. By measuring Brassica, cucurbit, and tomato insect pest and disease damage across the growing season, we confirmed that the importance of factors varies with crop species and by damage type. Both local complexity factors (e.g., number of trees and shrubs) and landscape complexity (percent natural cover in the landscape) relate to lower incidence of herbivore and disease damage on some crops, supporting our prediction that habitat heterogeneity at both local and landscape scales lowers plant damage. Greater temperature variability related to higher disease damage on tomatoes linking microclimate factors to disease prevalence. Yet, local complexity factors also related to higher incidence of plant damage for other crop species, indicating variable species-level impacts of local management factors on plant damage. By measuring the abundance of fungus-feeding lady beetles (Psyllobora) on cucurbits, we confirmed a strong association between natural enemies and powdery mildew. We provide a case study on how changes in local to landscape-scale factors relate to plant damage in urban agroecosystems and suggest how urban farmers and gardeners can apply this ecological knowledge to improve sustainable urban food production.",no,,,,,ECOSPHERE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2150-8925,NA,2020,10.1002/ecs2.3074,WOS:000530422900010

In this study, different non-lethal high temperatures and treatment durations were used to stress the third-instar larvae of B. odoriphaga, and the effects of this treatment on their growth and offspring were recorded and analyzed. The results showed that the average larval mortality increased with increased temperature and prolonged exposure times. After stress treatment at 40 degrees C for 2 h, 100% of larvae died within 5 days, which was not significantly different from the 5-day average larval mortality (90.66%) after stress at 37 degrees C for 4 h, but significantly higher than the 5-day average larval mortality (72.00%) after stress at 40 degrees C for 1 h. After 5 days, all still-living larvae could pupate, and there was no significant difference in average pupal period after pupation. However, the eclosion rate of subsequent pupae decreased with increased temperature and prolonged exposure times, and were only 43.00% and 42.73% after larvae were stressed at 37 degrees C for 4 h and 40 degrees C for 1 h, respectively. After eclosion into adults, there was no significant difference in the lifespan of unmated female adults, while the lifespan of unmated male adults was significantly reduced to 1.67 d and 2 d after larvae were stressed at 37 degrees C for 4 h and 40 degrees C for 1 h, respectively. However, there was no significant difference in male and female adult longevity after mating. There was no significant difference in oviposition or egg hatchability. This indicates that non-lethal high temperature at 37 degrees C for 4 h can hinder development and allow control of B. odoriphaga.

As a large group of poikilotherms, insects whose life activities are closely linked with ambient temperature are supposed to be influenced by global warming. In order to test the consistency or difference of the effects of long-term climate warming on phytophagous insect pests in different geographical environments, this study collected historical data on the occurrence and population dynamics of three aphid pests (Myzus persicae, Aphis gossypii, and Sitobion avenae) in China, and systematically explored their phenological responses. We found that, during a period of about 60 years, in general, the first occurrence dates and the first migration dates of the three aphids almost moved earlier, while the end of the occurrence and the last migration dates were slightly delayed. However, these responses also represented geographical variation at a local scale. Basically, our results showed that the occurrence and migration seasons of these three aphid pests have been prolonged along with climate warming.

To calculate economic thresholds, population growth parameters under varied temperature conditions are needed. However, detailed laboratory studies of temperature effects on the biology and population parameters of M. sacchari since the sorghum outbreak in the US have not been performed previously. Therefore, this study evaluated the response of M. sacchari to 6 different constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 32, and 35 degrees C) on sorghum tissue. Aphid development, age-specific survivorship, fecundity, and longevity were compared at the mentioned temperatures. At 20 degrees C, the reproductive period was longest and total fecundity was greatest. Development time of M. sacchari was shortest at 25 and 30 C. Intrinsic rate of increase was highest at 25 degrees C (r(m) = 0.405 +/- 0.030). Net reproductive rate (R-0) was highest at 20 degrees C, and age-specific survivorship decreased with increasing temperature.

A stepwise multiple regression revealed that minimum and mean temperature were factors that significantly affected the abundance of the tomato leafminer. The peaks of abundance coincided with high previous temperatures. Larval T. absoluta density was highest during the fruiting stage and the abundance was highest on the Cordilheira variety in all seasons and during the three crop years.

To forecast how this species might respond to climate change has emerged as one major challenge in recent viticultural research. Predictions about L. botrana population dynamics under global warming scenario are usually derived from physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs). Despite their ecological realism, PBDMs are based on physiological equations derived from constant, unrealistic thermal regimes, and they exclude the effects of temperature on male's reproductive traits, which importantly mediates population dynamics in this species. Focused on Burgundy (a viticultural region of France), we compared the adult performance of L. botrana between the Current Fluctuating Regime (CFR) based on in situ meteorological data and the Future Fluctuating Regime (FFR) based on the outputs of climate models. Under controlled conditions complying to the scenario of local warming termed FFR, L. botrana individuals incurred reduced adult lifespan, while their body amounts of four major energetic components (proteins, lipids, glycogen, soluble carbohydrates) remained unchanged compared to individuals exposed to the CFR. Furthermore, each sex endured reproductive costs associated with local warming scenario: females incurred reduced mating success, and males bore decreased fertility (lower number of eupyrene sperms within spermatophore). Our results indicate that global warming should adversely impact the reproductive success of L. botrana and the local abundance of this pest. In terms of pest management, our findings might contribute to the increase in the ecological realism of PBDMs and improve the reliability of their predictions about the population dynamics of L. botrana.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1612-4758,1612-4766,2020,10.1007/s10340-020-01201-1,WOS:000514810300012

J,"Ponce, C",Intra-seasonal climate variability and crop diversification strategies in the Peruvian Andes: A word of caution on the sustainability of adaptation to climate change,"Agricultural systems are highly sensitive to climate change. Most studies focus on the effect of heat and water availability on crop yields, but little is known about the impact of changes in intra-seasonal climate variability (particularly challenging in mountain regions). Also, beyond the effect on crop yields-mostly focused on single cropping systems and major world crops-little analysis has been done on more complex, diversified and low-input cropping systems like those prevalent in the Andean region. This study investigates whether Andean farmers respond to increasing climate variability by increasing crop diversity (measured by intercropping and crop diversification indices) and by switching to crops which better tolerate heterogeneous environmental conditions. Since previous studies show that crop diversification fosters resilience of agricultural systems, decreasing crop portfolio diversity in an increasingly variable environment may challenge farms sustainability. The data used in the analysis combines district-level socio-economic information from two agrarian censuses (1994 and 2012) with district-level climate estimates of mean temperature, temperature range and precipitation (averages for periods 1964-1994 and 1982-2012). Based on fixed effects models that allow for sub-region parameter heterogeneity, I find that an increase in intra-seasonal climate variability leads farmers in colder areas (<11 degrees C during the growing season) to concentrate their portfolio into more tolerant crops and reduce intercropping (a practice potentially efficient at controlling pest and disease). This effect is especially strong in the Southern region (more indigenous, less integrated to markets). These results complement previous studies by providing robust and regionally representative evidence on small-farmers' nonlinear response to climate variability. Furthermore, given that Andean farmers received little-to-no help to adapt to climate change during the period under analysis, this study informs about farmers' autonomous adaptation to climate changes and raises concern on current adaptation responses that may hamper agricultural system's sustainability in the face of climate change.

Dung beetles are also sensitive to climate change, which may impact on the services that they provide. Using climate-controlled chambers, we investigated the potential effects of climate change on the performance of a tunnelling dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus. Over two trials, we exposed beetles to a +0 degrees C, +2 degrees C or +4 degrees C increase in diurnally fluctuating field recorded temperatures and measured survival, pat departure, reproduction (brood number and size) and dung burial by beetles. Temperature treatment did not affect pat departure behaviour. Relative to the control +0 degrees C chambers, beetle survival was higher in the +2 degrees C chambers, but there was no difference in survival between the +0 degrees C and +4 degrees C chambers. In Trial 1, brood number was reduced in both the +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C chambers, relative to the +0 degrees C chambers. In Trial 2, brood number was significantly reduced relative to control chambers in the +2 degrees C chambers only. Temperature did not affect brood size. Across temperature treatments, there was a significant, positive relationship between brood number and dung burial. However, trends in brood production with temperature were not mirrored by dung burial; the only reduction in dung burial was found in the warmest treatment of Trial 2. Our results suggest that initially, warming may not substantially reduce dung burial by O. taurus; however, ecosystem services may be impacted if lower brood production eventually reduces beetle numbers. Studies such as ours identify the vulnerabilities of ecosystem service providers to climate change and in doing so are an essential first step in the management of ecosystem services under future warming.",no,,,,,AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2052-1758,2052-174X,2020,10.1111/aen.12448,WOS:000511004900001

Males of both species were trapped in an Egyptian guava orchard during the fruiting seasons of 2016 and 2017 and trap catches were compared with peak flights predicted by the DD model based on local weather data. Ceratitis capitata had faster development than B. zonata at 20 and 25 degrees C, but their overall developmental rate was similar at 30 and 35 degrees C. The thermal threshold of development (T-0) of B. zonata was higher than that of C. capitata, indicating greater sensitivity to cold. Although 35 degrees C yielded the fastest development of both species, survival was higher at 30 degrees C, with B. zonata experiencing a slight advantage, suggesting better tropical adaptation. Immature development of B. zonata and C. capitata was estimated to require 338 and 373 d, respectively, and 616 and 424 DD for a complete generation. Trap catches over both seasons showed good correspondence to peaks of fly activity predicted by the DD models; deviations from expectation ranged from 0 to 7 d for both fly species. Both species had four overlapping generations per season, with B. zonata abundance peaking in the first generation in both years, but only in 2016 for C. capitata.

The influence of temperature on intra- and interspecific larval interactions was studied using artificial stems kept at different constant temperatures (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 30 degrees C) in an incubator and assessing survival and relative growth rates of each species in single and multi-species experiments. After the inclusion of FAW into the experiments, with regard to relative growth rates, both intra- and interspecific competition was observed among all four species. With regard to survival rates, cannibalism can also explain the intra- and interspecific interactions observed among all four species. Interspecific competition was stronger between the stemborers than between the FAW and the stemborers. Similar to lepidopteran stemborers, temperature affected both survival and relative growth rates of the FAW as well. Regardless of the temperature, C. partellus was superior in interspecific interactions shown by higher relative growth and survival rates. The results suggest that the FAW will co-exist with stemborer species along entire temperature gradient, though competition and/or cannibalism with them is weak.

Besides, results from both age- and stage-structured matrix models indicated that lambda is more sensitive to changes in survival rates than in fecundity rates at all temperatures. Furthermore, female individuals at the ages of 46, 23, 14, 11 and 7 days had the highest contribution to population growth in comparison with other ages, when reared at the above-mentioned temperatures, respectively. Also, the sensitivity of lambda to the changes in survival of adults was higher than in other stages. Besides, the elasticity to fecundity rate at the age of first reproduction was considerably higher than those associated with the age of last reproduction. The survival rates (s(i)) generally exhibited a higher elasticity than the transition rates (g(i)).

To imitate the temperature conditions in summers, different developmental stages of A. hygrophila were treated with high temperatures from 32.5 degrees C to 45 degrees C for 1-5 h. Based on the survival rate, the heat tolerance of each developmental stage was ranked from lowest to highest as follows: egg, 1st, 2nd, 3rd instar larva, adult and pupa. Eggs showed the lowest heat tolerance with 37.5 degrees C as the critical temperature affecting larval hatching. Heat treatment of the A. hygrophila eggs at 37.5 degrees C for 1 h decreased the hatch rate to 24%. Our results indicated that when compared with the control at 25 degrees C, 1 h treatment at 37.5 degrees C prolonged the duration of the egg stage, shortened the duration of oviposition and total longevity, and changed the reproductive pattern of A. hygrophila. The net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate and finite rate were all significantly reduced. The results suggest that low heat tolerance of the eggs was the major factor responsible for the reduction of A. hygrophila populations, and the key temperature was 37.5 degrees C. Therefore, appropriate measures should be taken to protect eggs in order to maintain the efficacy of A. hygrophila in the biological control of A. philoxeroides in hot summers.",no,,,,,INSECT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1672-9609,1744-7917,2020,10.1111/1744-7917.12611,WOS:000487003900014
J,"Wang, CY; Fei, MH; Meng, L; Harvey, JA; Li, BP",Effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on survival and wing dimorphism of two species of rice planthoppers (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) under interaction,"BACKGROUND Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) may have significant impacts on insect herbivore communities including pests. Two of the most important climate-change related factors are increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), and increasing mean global temperature. Although increasing attention is being paid to the biological and ecological effects of ACC, important processes such as interspecific interaction between insect herbivores have been little explored. Here, in a field experiment using the FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) system, we investigated the effect of elevated CO2 and temperature on survival and wing dimorphism of two species of rice planthoppers, Laodelphax striatellus and Nilaparvata lugens under interaction. RESULTS The two species were grouped into five treatments of relative density (0/50, 13/37, 25/25, and 37/13, 50/0), each of which was allocated to one of a factorial combination of two CO2 concentrations and two temperature treatments (elevated and ambient levels). Our results revealed that climatic treatment has no effects on survivorship of interspecific competing planthoppers. However, climatic treatment affected wing-form of planthoppers under interspecific interaction. For females of N. lugens, in the 37/13 ratio, proportion macropterours form was lower under elevated CO2 + temperature than under the ambient environment or than under elevated temperature. For females of L. striatellus, proportion macropterous form did not differ among climatic treatments at each ratio treatment. CONCLUSION These findings illustrate that climate change-related factors, by affecting the macropetry of interspecific competing planthoppers, may influence planthopper fitness. We provide new information that could assist with forecasting outbreaks of these migratory pests.

J,"Havko, NE; Das, MR; McClain, AM; Kapali, G; Sharkey, TD; Howe, GA",Insect herbivory antagonizes leaf cooling responses to elevated temperature in tomato,"As global climate change brings elevated average temperatures and more frequent and extreme weather events, pressure from biotic stresses will become increasingly compounded by harsh abiotic stress conditions. The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) promotes resilience to many environmental stresses, including attack by arthropod herbivores whose feeding activity is often stimulated by rising temperatures. How wound-induced JA signaling affects plant adaptive responses to elevated temperature (ET), however, remains largely unknown. In this study, we used the commercially important crop plant Solanum lycopersicum (cultivated tomato) to investigate the interaction between simulated heat waves and wound-inducible JA responses. We provide evidence that the heat shock protein HSP90 enhances wound responses at ET by increasing the accumulation of the JA receptor, COI1. Wound-induced JA responses directly interfered with short-term adaptation to ET by blocking leaf hyponasty and evaporative cooling. Specifically, leaf damage inflicted by insect herbivory or mechanical wounding at ET resulted in COI1-dependent stomata! closure, leading to increased leaf temperature, lower photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate, and growth inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 reversed these effects to recapitulate the phenotype of a JA-insensitive mutant lacking the COI1 receptor. As climate change is predicted to compound biotic stress with larger and more voracious arthropod pest populations, our results suggest that antagonistic responses resulting from a combination of insect herbivory and moderate heat stress may exacerbate crop losses.",no,,,,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0027-8424,NA,2020,10.1073/pnas.1913885117,WOS:000509791700053

Although the consequences of variation in temperature for the development and reproduction of insects are generally appreciated, the consequences of potential interactions between temperature and prey for predatory insects are not. Thermal requirements and predation rates were determined for T. notata at different constant temperatures with both prey species. T. notata larvae developed to adults in experimental conditions > 18 to <38 degrees C. The upper thermal limit for egg hatch was 34 degrees C and for pupation was 33 degrees C. Adults reared at >= 32 degrees C did not lay eggs and survived less than 1 week. Prey species did not affect lower temperature thresholds or thermal constants for development from egg to adult. Furthermore, prey did not affect a number of reproductive traits, but the interaction between temperature and prey affected changes in developmental times and oviposition rate with age. Predation rate of T. notata increased as a function of temperature, and T. notata adults generally consumed more nymphs of P. citri than F. dasyrilii.

Here, a 25-year dataset on climate, cropping planting structure, and the population dynamics of cotton bollworms (Helicoverpa armigera) from Bachu County, south Xinjiang, China, was analyzed to assess the effects of changes in climate and crop planting structure on the population dynamics of H. armigera. The three generations of H. armigera showed increasing trends in population size with climate warming, especially in the third generation. The relative abundances of the first and second generations decreased, but that of the third generation increased. Rising temperature and precipitation produced different impacts on the development of different generations. The population numbers of H. armigera increased with the increase in the non-Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton-planted area. Asynchrony of abrupt changes existed among climate change, crop flowering dates, and the phenology of H. armigera moths. The asynchronous responses in crop flowering dates and phenology of H. armigera to climate warming would expand in the future. The primary factors affecting the first, second, and third generations of moths were T-mean in June, the last appearance date of the second generation of moths, and the duration of the third generation of moths, respectively.

By understanding which habitats are most vulnerable to invasion, pest managers can prioritise their surveillance areas to focus on those most at risk. We assessed temporal and spatial invasion by ants within forested and non-forested ecosystems using a replicated sample design based on data collected in 2005 and by repeating the sampling 10 years later. We predicted that forested ecosystems would be more resistant than non-forested ecosystems to invasion, likely due to unfavourable habitat factors that limit ant establishment and spread, even after a 10-year period. In both sampling years, non-forested ecosystems were more susceptible to invasion by non-native ants, with ants being found at both the edge and in the interior of these habitats. Conversely, in forested ecosystems, non-native ants were concentrated on the forest edges. Although there was invasion of non-native ant species further into some non-forested ecosystems over the 10-year period, spread did not penetrate beyond the edge in forest ecosystems suggesting that habitat characteristics are important in determining non-native ant spread.

Despite evidence that climate warming shifts pollinator phenology, a general assessment of these shifts and their consequences on pollinator assemblages is still lacking. By analysing phenological shifts of over 2,000 species, we show that, on average, the mean flight date of European pollinators shifted to be 6 d earlier over the last 60 yr, while their flight period length decreased by 2 d. Our analysis further reveals that these shifts have probably altered the seasonal distribution of pollination function and services by decreasing the overlap among pollinators' phenologies within European assemblages, except in the most northeastern part of Europe. Such changes are expected to decrease the functional redundancy and complementarity of pollinator assemblages and, therefore, might alter the performance of pollination function and services and their robustness to ongoing pollinator extinctions.",no,,,,,NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2397-334X,NA,2020,10.1038/s41559-019-1062-4,WOS:000511459500001

This species severely impacts global potato production, especially in China and India, which have the world's largest potato production. We developed two indices considering host plant availability and production in addition to climatic suitability, which was simulated using the CLIMEX model. Thus, three different indices were used to project potential distribution of the potato tuber moth under a climate change scenario: (1) climatic suitability (ecoclimatic index (EI)) (EIM), (2) climatic suitability combined with host plant availability (EIN1), and (3) climatic suitability combined with host plant production (EIN2). Under the current climate, EIM was high in southern India and central to southern China, while EIN1 and EIN2 were approximately 38% and 20% lower than EIM, respectively. Under the Special Report on Emissions Scenario A1B, the potato tuber moth would probably not occur in India, but its distribution could be extended to the north, reaching N47 degrees. The areas with the highest climatic suitability by potato tuber moth based on three indices were Sichuan and Karnataka in response to climate change.

Future climate data were simulated based on global climate models from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under the RCP4.5 projection. The potential distribution of C. lapathi under historical climate conditions mainly includes North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. Future global warming may cause a northward shift in the northern boundary of potential distribution. The total suitable area would increase by 2080-2100. Additionally, climatic suitability would change in large regions of the northern hemisphere and decrease in a small region of the southern hemisphere. The projected potential distribution will help determine the impacts of climate change and identify areas at risk of pest invasion in the future.

This pest is thus a threat to the chip potato industry and often requires preventive measures including the use of costly insecticides. The objectives of this research were to monitor the variation in B. cockerelli adult abundance and to evaluate the risk of zebra chip disease in northwestern New Mexico, USA. Yellow sticky traps were used to collect the pest at the Agricultural Experiment Station at Farmington, NM and in nearby commercial fields at the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry (NAPI) and Navajo Mesa Farms during the 2017-2019 period. The collected adult pests were analyzed at Texas A & M University for the presence of Candidatus L. solanacearum (Lso). The results showed field infestation by B. cockerelli in early June and that the population peaked during the second half of July and decreased as the potato growing season progressed. However, a second less important peak of the pest was revealed around mid- to late-August, depending on the growing season and field. While the B. cockerelli population increased linearly with average air temperature, it showed strong third order polynomial relationships with the accumulated thermal units and the Julian days. The test of B. cockerelli for the Lso infection revealed a low incidence of the pathogen varying from 0.22% to 6.25% and the infected adult B. cockerelli were collected during the population peak period. The results of this study may be helpful to potato growers in pest management decision-making and control.

Thankfully, the biological control agent Torymus sinensis has proven to effectively control and reduce the D. kuriphilus population. The reaction of chestnut trees to decreasing D. kuriphilus pressure, however, has been sparsely investigated. In this study, we analyze the recovery patterns of chestnut trees since the pest epidemic peak in 15 sites in southern Switzerland that were differently affected by the dephased arrival of D. kuriphilus and T. sinensis. By using various tree damage and insect population indicators, we show how damage varies as a function of the time elapsed between pest arrival and biological control by T. sinensis. Specifically, trees in sites experiencing seven years of D. kuriphilus uncontrolled attacks show large dying crown portions and stress-induced reactions (e.g., suckers along the stem) compared to sites where the two insects arrived nearly simultaneously.

Coupled with effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition this could result in an overall decrease in survival and growth. In order to improve our understanding of the key limiting factors affecting trembling aspen we investigated survival probability and tree growth using data from an extensive network of permanent sample plots in Alberta (Canada). We developed mixed-effect non-linear models which included: tree size, competition, climate, pest incidence and time elapsed between consecutive measurements as predictor variables. Tree data from 1144 Permanent Sample Plots representing 39,394 trees for a total of 52,522 growth interval observations were used to develop these models. Annual data on aspen defoliation were available for the period 1990-2010, and the average Climate Moisture Index (CMI) was calculated for each measured interval by location. Intraspecific competition and competition from conifer species (i.e. spruce/fir and pine), had a strong negative effect on survival and growth. Aspen defoliators such as the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hbn.), the large aspen tortrix (Choristoneura conflictana) and the Bruce spanworm (Operophtera bruceata) had a negative impact on survival, but a strong positive effect on growth of surviving trembling aspen (i.e. compensatory growth). Increasing levels of CMI, which are associated with relatively cooler and wetter conditions, had a positive effect on survival and growth. Model validation results indicated good performance for survival and tree growth predictions. This study indicates that trembling aspen is very sensitive to competition, insect damage, and climate (i.e. drought); respectively, and this behavior will likely intensify as climate warms. The models developed in this study enhance our understanding of trembling aspen survival and growth in boreal North America and could be used to improve the predictive ability of existing growth and yield models.",no,,,,,NEW FORESTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0169-4286,1573-5095,2020,10.1007/s11056-019-09726-9,WOS:000511749100010

Options for Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) control at increased temperatures,"Global climate change is expected to accelerate reproduction, development and activity of storedproduct insect pests and degradation of grain protectants hence compromising efficacy of available storage pest management technologies. However, there is little information on these effects. The current laboratory study examined the effect of increasing temperatures on the efficacy of stored maize grain protectants and hermetic containers in controlling Prostephanus truncatus (Horn). In Experiment I, three commercial synthetic grain pesticides (cocktails of an organophosphate and a pyrethroid or a neonicotinoid) and two farmer-practices (neem leaf powder and wood ash) were tested on shelled maize grain. In Experiment II, four storage containers, viz Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bag, Super Grain bag (SGB), metal silo (MS) and polypropylene bag (PP) (all containing untreated maize) were tested. Both experiments were conducted for 12 weeks at 32 degrees C, 38 degrees C and mean ambient temperature of 26 degrees C; with three replicates per treatment. All treatments were artificially infested with laboratory-reared adult P. truncatus. Sampling was at baseline (0 weeks) and 4-weekly intervals. Overall, results showed significant differences in grain damage and weight losses between non-synthetic and synthetic grain protectants in all treatments at all tested conditions. The hermetic storage containers kept mean insect grain damage below 6.4% compared to 24.5% in the untreated control at all the experimental conditions. These results indicate that the use of synthetic grain protectants and hermetic storage containers (SGB, PICS and MS) in the management of P. truncatus may not be negatively affected by projected warmer temperatures of 32 degrees C or 38 degrees C; suggesting these storage technologies will remain efficacious under sub-Saharan Africa's warming climates.

However, deltamethrin and Bt Cry1Ac are commonly used insecticides against P. xylostella but studies involving development of resistance in P. xylostella against these two insecticides at different temperatures are lacking. The current study was aimed to find out the toxicity of deltamethrin and Bt Cry1Ac, and resistance development in P. xylostella. Results showed that the positive correlation between the temperature and toxicities of deltamethrin and Bt Cry1Ac. The results indicated -0.051, -0.049, -0.047, and -0.046 folds of deltamethrin resistance at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 30 degrees C temperatures, respectively from 1st to 12th generations.

Extreme droughts reduce stand productivity, increase vulnerability to pests, and can even provoke mortality. Growth dynamics at tree and forest stand levels are considered the main indicators of stability and productivity in forest ecosystem structures. The main climate drivers for tree growth were identified using basal area increment (BAI) as a synthetic indicator. BAI chronologies were obtained from increment cores for 1960-2012 period. Six species were analysed in an attempt to identify their growth limiting factors. For the most important oak species in Romania, resilience components were computed in order to analyse their response to drought events. Moreover, growth dynamics were analysed for two species in mixed and monoculture forests. The results suggest that - in comparison to Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica, the sensitivity of Quercus spp. is much higher (0.3-0.47). Oakspecies situated in the most drought-affected areas are sensitive to rainfall values from the previous autumn, current spring, and early summer, with April monthly values having the most significant effect on BAI increment (r = 0.47*) The most sensitive species to drought is Q. cerris and Q.jruinetto. Their BAI reduction during drought is >50% compared with the BAI values before the drought period. The recovery capacity of tree growth following drought events is lower for Q. robur and Q. petraea and higher for Q. cerris and Q.frainetto.

Cotton has a great dependence on environmental factors during its growth, especially climate change. In recent years, machine learning and especially deep learning methods have been widely used in many fields and have achieved good results. Methods: First, this papaer used the common Aprioro algorithm to find the association rules between weather factors and the occurrence of cotton pests. Then, in this paper, the problem of predicting the occurrence of pests and diseases is formulated as time series prediction, and an LSTM-based method was developed to solve the problem. Results: The association analysis reveals that moderate temperature, humid air, low wind spreed and rain fall in autumn and winter are more likely to occur cotton pests and diseases. The discovery was then used to predict the occurrence of pests and diseases. Experimental results showed that LSTM performs well on the prediction of occurrence of pests and diseases in cotton fields, and yields the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97. Conclusion: Suitable temperature, humidity, low rainfall, low wind speed, suitable sunshine time and low evaporation are more likely to cause cotton pests and diseases.

The understanding of species invasion under climate change is crucial for sustainable biodiversity conservation, community dynamics, ecosystem function, and resource distribution. Two invasive species, Dysmicoccus brevipes (Cockerell) and D. neobrevipes (Beardsley) have greatly expanded their ranges during recent years. These insects are now considered as extremely serious pests for various plants, especially pineapple. In addition, they are the primary vectors for pineapple wilt associated virus. However, the potential distribution range and management strategies for these pests are unclear. RESULTS In this study, potential risk maps were developed for these pests with MaxEnt (maximum entropy) based on occurrence data under different environmental variables. The potential distributions of these pests were projected for 2050s and 2070s under three climate change scenarios as described in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Results showed that both pests have similar potential distributions, with high environmental suitability in South America, Africa and South Asia. In addition, potential range expansions or reductions were predicted under different climate change scenarios. The annual mean temperature was the most important factor, accounting for 43.4% of D. brevipes distribution. The minimum temperature of coldest month and mean temperature of coldest quarter was found to be responsible for 90.3% of D. neobrevipes distribution.

Here we investigate the foraging ecology of Acromyrmex subterraneus(Fore)) in the Brazilian cerrado savanna. We examined the species activity pattern, forage material collected, and the relationship between load mass and forager size. Ant activity peaked at night and was negatively related to temperature but positively related to relative air humidity. The majority of the items collected by ants was plant material: dry and fresh leaves, flowers, and fruits.Trunk trails ranged from 0.7 to 13 m and colony home ranged from 2 to 28 m(2), indicating that ants collect material nearby the nest. Total load mass was positively associated with forager size, especially in the case of leaves. The negative relationship between ant size and burden suggests that ants might optimize their delivery rate by collecting lighter substrates more frequently.

Ecological intensification is an approach proposed to partially replace external inputs with the provision of biodiversity-derived ecosystems services to either maintain or increase food production. One promising practice is crop diversification, which has the potential to improve the provision of multiple ecosystem services underpinning agricultural production, and to confer resilience to abiotic stresses. This study measured a variety of ecosystem services (yield quantity and quality, soil services, pest regulation), and resistance indicators (canopy temperature and senescence rates) under stressed and controled conditions, at three levels of crop rotational diversity in the third year of the rotations. We found that increased crop diversity can maintain yields with reduced external inputs, under varying climatic conditions, with yield increases of 1 t/ha on average, and that diversifying crop rotations can improve stress resistance resulting in more resilient systems. Higher crop diversity resulted in no trade-offs between our measured ecosystem services and increased synergistic effects between stress resistance and crop production and stress resistance and pest regulation.

In this study, an effort is made to develop forewarning model using the field data on aphid for 12 consecutive rabi seasons from 2003-2004 to 2014-2015 under different agro-climatic locations in India. Three main components of aphid-related stages were identified for which necessary forewarnings were needed to be issued: (1) severity, (2) the time of reaching the economic threshold level (ETL) for decision-making on pesticide application, and (3) time of occurrence of peak population. To address these, three different models were developed/used and validated using incident field dataset. Those field observations when the infestation level were below severe category (< 60) during rising phase of the aphid population were found to indicate highest R sqr.

J,"Singh, G; Saha, G; Roy, K; Sattar, A",Assessing the impact of micro climate on population dynamics of onion thrips in gangetic west bengal,"Onion thrips (Thrips tabaci L. (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)), is the most important polyphagous pest in onion crop as it significantly affects the productivity and marketability of onion bulbs globally. However, spatial and temporal variability in the infestation of onion thrips is highly variable and generally inconsistent with environmental conditions, which regulate its development and reproduction. In fact, thrips population gets affected due to varying weather pattern under different agro-climatic conditions. However, the information on seasonal thrips population density and their relationship with microclimate, is scarce in New Alluvial Agro Climatic Zone of West Bengal under varying management practices. In view of the above, the present study was conducted at Research Farm, Gayespur of Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani, Nadia, West Bengal during kharif seasons of 2014 and 2015, and rabi seasons of 2014-15 and 2015-16. The results revealed that temperature and relative humidity within the onion crop canopy were higher at early growth stages for all treatments. In contrast, incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and reflected PAR were observed to be maximum during reproductive phases and minimum during vegetative phases of the crop.Soil temperature in the cropped field, followed a consistently upward trend during active vegetative period, followed by drastic reduction at the initiation of reproductive phases. No abiotic stress was observed for kharif onion. During rabi season, planting date was found to be significantly influencing the microclimatic environment of onion crop However, spacing schedules exerted less influence on behaviour of microclimate. Treatment combinations of P4S1(22nd November, 15cmx10cm)and P4S2(22nd November, 20cmx15cm), shortened the onion maturity by 20 days. Canopy temperature and relative humidity exhibited higher values, during later part of onion growth. Results on temporal dynamics of thrips population in kharif season showed that earliest incidence of thrips was recorded at 65DAP and 58 DAP in the crop planted on 14th August and 21st August, respectively and at 51DAP for both P3 (28th August) and P4 (4th September) planted crops. In case of rabi season, it was found that first incidence of thrips started at 40 DAP, which went on increasing till 68 DAP for each treatment. Moreover, declining trend was also noted from 75 DAP onwards. Increase in thrips population was observed to be associated with changes in cumulative degree days during active reproductive phase. Significant correlations of thrips population with canopy temperature, canopy humidity and soil temperature were observed.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY,NA,NA,3rd International Symposium on Advances in Agrometeorology for Managing Climatic Risks of Farmers (INAGMET),"FEB 11-13, 2019","New Delhi, INDIA","Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Indian Council Agr Res & Indian Agr Res Inst, India Meteorol Dept, Assoc Agrometeorologists, Delhi Chapter",NA,NA,NA,,0972-1665,NA,2019,NA,WOS:000595340000009

The appearance of larva was observed throughout the soybean growing season, and the peak incidence was observed during third week of August to first week of September (34-35 SMW). The correlation analysis of the data revealed that larval population was significantly and positively influenced by the minimum temperature and rainfall of current week as well as previous two weeks. For the development of forewarning model, data for the period from 2010 to 2013 were used as training dataset and two year (2014-2015) data as validation dataset. The mean model used for forewarning the incidence of pod borer larval population was developed by using step-wise multiple regression analysis in polynomial form. The results of mean model revealed that the significant variables affecting the pod borer larval population in soybean were maximum temperature (current and 1st lag week), and rainfall (current week) and the model explained 48.93% variation. The pre-disposing conditions for the incidence of larvae have been worked out as maximum temperature ranging from 26.1 to 31.47 degrees C and rainfall ranging from 6.63 to 141.46 mm with low or medium rainfall in previous weeks followed by high in current week.

Four treatment plots were defined with three tree-shading levels in a 20 years old agroforestry system combining organic vegetable crops with hybrid walnut trees. Temperature and canopy openness were recorded in each treatment in July and September 2015 and arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps at two dates (2 weeks in July and 2 weeks in September). The daily activity pattern of the main taxa was then estimated using dry pitfall traps for 7 days in July and 8 days in September. Agroforestry significantly limited the daily temperature extremes in the day and night (+/- 1.5 degrees C). We observed a significant effect of treatment on species distribution. In July, the main xerophilic species, Pseudoophonus rufipes (Coleoptera, Carabidae), was less abundant in the two most shaded plots (-25%). Pardosa hortensis (Arachnida, Lycosidae) showed significant differences in activity-density and diurnal activity between treatments. This spider was more active between 10:00 and 14:00 in the two most shaded treatments especially in tomatoes (more than 20% of the daily activity) compared to the control (13%). The activity-density of this species was also higher in the two shaded treatments than in the control (>20%).

Besides, having described the climatic profile of the species, we explored the contribution percentage of the bioclimatic variables. The accuracy and performance of distribution models were also evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). According to Jackknife, the annual precipitation, the precipitation of the wettest month, and the precipitation of the coldest quarter were regarded as the most important predictors for A. arabicum distribution model. The maximum temperature of warmest month, the precipitation of the wettest month, and the precipitation of driest quarter for A. breviceps; and also for A. millierei temperature seasonality, the precipitation of coldest quarter, and the precipitation of wettest month were the most effective variables on species distribution. The AUC values, based on training data, were respectively 0.83 for A. arabicum, 0.89 for A. breviceps, and 0.83 for A. millierei.

J,"Jakoby, O; Lischke, H; Wermelinger, B",Climate change alters elevational phenology patterns of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus),"The European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is the most important insect pest in Central European forests. Under climate change, its phenology is presumed to be changing and mass infestations becoming more likely. While several studies have investigated climate effects across a latitudinal gradient, it remains an open question how phenology will change depending on elevation and topology. Knowing how an altered climate is likely to affect bark beetle populations, particularly across diverse topographies and elevations, is essential for adaptive management. We developed a time-varying distributed delay model to predict the phenology of I. typographus. This approach has the particular advantage of capturing the variability within populations and thus representing its stage structure at any time. The model is applied for three regional climate change scenarios, A1B, A2 and RCP3PD, to the diverse topography of Switzerland, covering a large range of elevations, aspects and slopes. We found a strong negative relationship between voltinism and elevation. Under climate change, the model predicts an increasing number of generations over the whole elevational gradient, which will be more pronounced at low elevations. In contrast, the pre-shift in spring swarming is expected to be greater at higher elevations. In comparison, the general trend of faster beetle development on steep southern slopes is only of minor importance. Overall, the maximum elevation allowing a complete yearly generation will move upwards. Generally, the predicted increase in number of generations, earlier spring swarming, more aggregated swarming, together with a projected increase in drought and storm events, will result in a higher risk of mass infestations. This will increase the pressure on spruce stands particularly in the lowlands and require intensified management efforts. It calls for adapted long-term silvicultural strategies to mitigate the loss of ecosystem services such as timber production protection against rockfall and avalanches and carbon storage.",no,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,1365-2486,2019,10.1111/gcb.14766,WOS:000494691700006

Crucially, the tri-trophic responses of plants, herbivores and their natural enemies to warming are poorly understood. To delineate these interactive properties, a three-system approach and integrating life table methodology were used to examine the responses of wheat plants, English grain aphid and parasitoids under open-field infrared heating to simulate warming. RESULTSWarming significantly increased wheat biomass and grain weight, causing a phenological shift in plant growth. Importantly, warming significantly increased the number of aphids and the reproductive period, coupled with a higher net reproductive rate and intrinsic growth rate. Otherwise, duration of development, generation span, and population doubling time all decreased significantly. Warming had no effect on parasitoid abundance but resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of parasitism. CONCLUSIONWarming may strengthen bottom-up effects on aphids by increasing wheat biomass, resulting in reduced regulation of aphid populations. Warming had a different effect on parasitoids between 2015 and 2016. These findings provide an important characterization of ecological mechanisms in plant-herbivore-parasitoid systems and give a theoretical foundation for improved forecasting of aphid population dynamics under climate change.

However, they have limitations in predicting the introduced ranges of invasive species that could be overcome by using species eco-physiological traits. By combining bioclimatic variables with thermal tolerance plasticity of the highly invasive little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, we intend to better understand the mechanism underlying its current and future distributions. To this end, we performed: (1) laboratory physiological experiments to assess thermal tolerances (CTmin and CTmax) and evaluate the effect of acclimation (laboratory) and acclimatization (nature) on these variables, (2) behavioral foraging observations in the field, (3) a correlative and a simple mechanistic SDM. Briefly, physiological results showed a modulation of the CTmax and CTmin by different acclimation temperatures and by seasonal thermal acclimatization. In the field, worker foraging activity begins at environmental temperatures just above (less than 1 degrees C) the lowest CTmin recorded in the laboratory. At the global scale, CTmin constitutes a key physiological trait that, when linked with the minimum temperature of the coldest month, could explain the southernmost limit of W. auropunctata native distribution and its physiological capacity to expand in the Mediterranean region. The eco-physiological approach carried out here may help explain the current distribution and predict potential spread of populations when there is no certain information about the whole distribution of the species or under a changing environment.

Although T. evansi is of South American subtropical origin, it has recently expanded its distribution range to many tropical and temperate areas around the world. Its potential distribution range in response to scenarios of global warming was recently modeled, confirming its current and possible future distributions. Here, we experimentally investigated the biological traits of T. evansi in the context of the current and future global warming (2100) scenarios. Using an environmental simulation system, we tested the life-history traits of T. evansi under current summer temperatures (as of June, July, and August 2016) and under expected temperature increases based on two IPCC scenarios: RCP2.6 (+ 1 degrees C) and RCP8.5 (+ 3.7 degrees C). The mites were introduced into each scenario on 1 June and their sequential progeny were used for testing in each following month. Results The mite could develop and reproduce under all scenarios. There was a decrease in the duration of lifespan and female fecundity at RCP8.5 during June and August, but this may be compensated for by the high intrinsic rate of increase, which implies faster population growth and shorter generation time. Conclusion Our study and other reports reveal the high adaptability of T. evansi to a wide range of summer temperatures; this may explain its current distribution. We anticipate that global warming will favor the spread of T. evansi and may further expand its distribution to a large area of the globe.

The cotton whitefly, B. tabaci is a major pest of potato as it transmits the Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (potato) causing the Apical leaf curl disease which leads to huge yield losses. The population dynamics of cotton whitefly was studied at 12 locations across the northern plains of India from 2015-17. It was observed that the cotton whitefly appears on potato immediately after crop emergence. The whitefly adults exhibited four different patterns of population dynamics at different locations. Whiteflies remained on the potato crop as long as minimum daily temperature was above 10-12 degrees C after which the whiteflies either disappeared from the crops or their flight activity was considerably reduced as indicted by the yellow sticky trap catch data. The whitefly incidence was higher at locations where potato is preceded by crops preferred by whitefly such as cotton, broad beans, groundnut etc. Perusal of the data on number of eggs laid and ensuing nymphs per plant indicated that the contribution of immigrating adults to the whitefly population is much higher than that of the colonising population for major part of the crop period. Thus, in addition to temperature, cropping sequence acts as a major factor in shaping the pattern of whitefly infestation.

J,"Martinez-Abrain, A; Jimenez, J",Dealing with growing forest insect pests: The role of top-down regulationPalabras Clave,"Forest insect pests are becoming increasingly common in Europe. A recent paper published in this journal dealt with a particular case of pest spreading in Portuguese coniferous forests. The authors discussed the effect that mass trapping and clear-cut belts had on slowing down the invasion and suggested that likely causes of pest spreading are stress due to global warming and the introduction of exotic species. Inspired by that paper, we defend here the point that forest communities are not only regulated by bottom-up mechanisms, such as water stress, but also by top-down mechanisms, such as predation. We provide information from European metadata showing that forest biomass grew by 38% (1991-2015) whereas forest insectivorous passerine trends were stable (1980-2016).Synthesis and applications. We suggest that rebounding European forests are too young to support large communities of insectivorous birds and that an effective way to solve pest problems could be to promote the use of nest boxes for them (and for other insect predators), as it was done in the past in large reforestations implemented in Spain. Additionally, the presence of large mammalian herbivores is needed to reduce the density of trees in forests. Priority should be given to this ecological management in comparison with massive trapping and clear-cut belt construction or at least it should be used together with those engineering practices.

Inspirados por este articulo defendemos aqui que las comunidades forestales no estan reguladas solo por mecanismos que operan de abajo-arriba (bottom-up), como el estres hidrico, sino tambien por mecanismos que operan de arriba-abajo (top-down), como la depredacion.

Sugerimos que las masas forestales en recuperacion son demasiado jovenes para albergar grandes comunidades de aves insectivoras y que una posible medida para disponer de masas forestales sanas, alternativa al trampeo masivo de insectos, podria ser la instalacion de cajas nido para fauna insectivora, como se hizo en el pasado en Espana, en epocas de repoblacion masiva con coniferas. Ademas de ello seria necesario potenciar la abundancia de los grandes mamiferos herbivoros para reducir las altas densidades actuales de las masas forestales.

Wild and transgenic fruit flies of Bactrocera dorsalis were subjected to oscillating regimes that represent current temperature conditions (mean: 28.6 degrees C) and various future possible scenarios (means: 30.0, 32.5 and 35.0 degrees C). As the temperature was increased to 30.0 degrees C, the negative effects on adult fecundity and demographic parameters (net reproductive rate and intrinsic rate of increase) of only the transgenic cohorts increased. With a moderate warming (32.5 degrees C), negative effects were observed on the net reproductive rate for both fly strains, and these effects on the life-history traits (adult fecundity and longevity) and intrinsic rate of increase were stronger in the transgenic than in the wild cohorts, with reference to the trait values at 30.0 degrees C. A severe warming (35.0 degrees C) resulted in the failure of all individuals of both fly strains to reach adulthood.

Kilimanjaro, Tanzania","Temperature, primary productivity, plant functional traits, and herbivore abundances are considered key predictors of leaf herbivory but their direct and indirect contributions to community-level herbivory are not well understood along broad climatic gradients. Here, we determined elevational herbivory patterns and used a path analytical approach to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of climate, land use, net primary productivity (NPP), herbivore abundance, and plant functional traits on community-level invertebrate herbivory along the extensive elevational and land use gradients at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. We recorded standing leaf herbivory caused by leaf chewers, leaf miners and leaf gallers on 55 study sites distributed in natural and anthropogenic habitats along a 3,060 m elevation gradient. We related the total community-level herbivory to climate (temperature and precipitation), NPP, plant functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf carbon-to-nitrogen [CN] ratio and leaf nitrogen-to-phosphorus [NP] ratio) and herbivore abundances. Leaf herbivory ranged from 5% to 11% along the elevation gradient. Total leaf herbivory showed unimodal pattern in natural habitats but a strongly contrasting bimodal pattern in anthropogenic habitats. We also detected some variation in the patterns of leaf herbivory along environmental gradients across feeding guilds with leaf chewers being responsible for a disproportionally large part of herbivory. Path analyses indicated that the variation in leaf herbivory was mainly driven by changes in leaf CN and NP ratios which were closely linked to changes in NPP in natural habitats. Similarly, patterns of leaf herbivory in anthropogenic habitats were best explained by variation in leaf CN ratios and a negative effect of land use. Our study elucidates the strong role of leaf nutrient stoichiometry and its linkages to climate and NPP for explaining the variation in leaf herbivory along broad climatic gradients. Furthermore, the study suggests that climatic changes and nutrient inputs in the course of land use change may alter leaf herbivory and consequently energy and nutrient fluxes in terrestrial habitats.",yes,field,damage,,,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0021-8790,1365-2656,2019,10.1111/1365-2656.13058,WOS:000494336600013

It occurs in Arab countries including Oman. In this paper, the logistic, ordinary least square, and geographical weighted regressions were applied to model the absence/presence and density of DB against climate factors. A method is proposed for modelling spatially correlated prorations annually over the study period, based on annual and seasonal outbreaks. The historical 2006-2015 climate data were obtained from weather stations located in nine governorates in northern Oman, while dataloggers collected the 2017 microclimate data in eight of these nine governorates. RESULTS Logistic regression model showed the percentages of correctly predicted values using a cut-off point of 0.5 were 90%, 88% and 84%, indicating good classification accuracy. OLS and GWR models showed an overall trend of strong linear correlation between DB infestation levels and short- and long-term climate factors. The three models suggested that precipitation, elevation, temperature, humidity, wind direction and wind speed are important in influencing the spatial distribution and the presence/absence of dense DB populations. CONCLUSION The results provide an improved understanding of climate factors that impact DB's spread and is considered useful for managing DB infestations in date palm plantations.

Various infectious arbovirus diseases can be transmitted by Ae. aegypti. With ongoing global climate change, we are facing an increasing public health threat from the rapid spread of disease vectors into wider geographical areas. To better understand the current ecological niche range and possible future expansion of Ae. aegypti, an ecological niche modelling approach was adopted to predict its current and future potential habitat in Taiwan, China. RESULTS Based on observed occurrence records and environmental layers reflecting climate and land-use conditions, predictions with a high resolution of 30 arcsec (approx. 1 x 1 km) were made by our model. Ae. aegypti was predicted to expand its habitat in varying degrees out of its current niche range under different climate scenarios for the future 21st century. Winter temperature and dry season precipitation were considered as important predictors among climate variables. Croplands, pasture, forested lands and urban lands were important land-use variables. CONCLUSION Ae. aegypti is expected to establish new habitats out of its current niche range under the trend of global climate change. The extent of habitat expansion varies under different climate scenarios. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent its expansion to a broader scale. Our study has important strategic implications for mosquito surveillance and the prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases.

To understand the effect of climate change on the northward spread of the pest, studies on the growth and development of S. inferens on maize (Zea mays L.) were planned with combinations of temperature and CO2. The combinations were 27: 22 degrees C and 375 ppm of CO2, 32: 26 degrees C and 375 ppm of CO2, 27: 22 degrees C and 450 ppm of CO2 and 32: 26 degrees C and 450 ppm of CO2. Various developmental parameters of S. inferens were analyzed using analysis of variance for the main effects of temperature and CO2 and their interactions. At elevated temperature, the growth of egg, larval and pupal stages were faster and the developmental period decreased by 30.9%. At elevated CO2, the larval and pupal development delayed and there was 5.7% increase in developmental period. Both temperature and CO2 individually and in combination significantly influenced adult longevity. Adult longevity reduced 24.9% and 21.7% in male and female, respectively at elevated temperature. Whereas, at elevated CO2, adult longevity increased 7.6% in male and 6.8% in female, respectively. The fecundity was positively influenced (+10.8%) by elevated temperature and negatively (-14.4%) by elevated CO2. The effects of temperature and CO2 on the development of pink stem borer were opposite, with temperature being positive and predominant in influencing the biology of S. inferens.

In the present study, we tested the influence of temperature, day length, and seasonality on the expression of alternative developmental pathways and compared the differences in life history traits between diapausing and directly developing individuals under laboratory and field conditions. The expression of developmental pathway strongly depended on temperature, day length, and seasonality. Low temperatures induced almost all individuals to enter diapause regardless of day length; relatively high temperatures combined with intermediate and longer day lengths resulted in most individuals developing without diapause in the laboratory. The field data revealed that the degree of phenotypic plasticity in relation to developmental pathway was much higher in autumn than in spring. Directly developing individuals showed shorter development times and higher growth rates than did diapausing individuals. The pupal and adult weights for both diapausing and directly developing individuals gradually decreased as rearing temperature increased, with the diapausing individuals being slightly heavier than the directly developing individuals at each temperature. Female body weight was slightly lower than male body weight. The proportional weight losses from pupa to adult were almost the same in diapausing individuals and in directly developing individuals, suggesting that diapause did not affect weight loss at metamorphosis.

In the low altitudes of these forests, the invasive species Cydalima perspectalis (Walker) causes considerable damage, and there is concern that it will migrate towards the natural forests at higher altitudes. To determine the biological parameters of the local pest population, a semiartificial diet with lyophilized powdered Buxus sempervirens L. leaves was developed. The results obtained indicate that the studied population of C. perspectalis is very similar to the native Japanese population in terms of the number of larval instars to complete development, the development rate and the critical photoperiod for the induction of diapause. It has also been demonstrated that long photoperiods can shorten the duration of larval development. The diapause induction response was classified as type I, and diapause termination was classified as type III. At the two studied temperatures, 25o and 15oC, the larvae seemed to require a similar number of days in diapause, approximately 3 months, to spontaneously resume development; temperatures can also prompt larvae to resume development. The critical photoperiod in the study area occurs during the second half of August, varying somewhat according to temperature. The greatest defoliation is caused by the offspring of the first generation, while the majority of the larval offspring of the second generation will enter diapause. The survival of natural boxwood in this area will depend on its ability to regrow one or two years after extensive defoliation and on the adaptation of several indigenous natural enemies in the region to feed on C. perspectalis.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0931-2048,1439-0418,NA,10.1111/jen.12709,WOS:000489155300001

F. occidentalis was found breeding on several crop weeds that often flower throughout the year, including common chickweed (Stellaria media), groundsel (Senecio vulgaris) and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale). F. occidentalis female adults were found throughout the winter in flowers of these weeds and caught every month on blue sticky traps. Transparent emergence traps placed over various locations in a second-year crop in March caught adult thrips over the following month, showing that thrips survived within the crop. Second-year strawberry crops had earlier infestations and significantly more F. occidentalis adults per flower than nearby first-year crops at the start of the season, indicating that thrips that overwinter in and around retained crops contribute to pest build-up in the following season. Control of overwintering F. occidentalis after the end of first-year cropping before second-year cropping, or growing crops for only 1 year, is a potential strategy to improve thrips management in strawberry.

Using 7 yr of consistent trapping of adults at four blueberry farms in Michigan, United States, we modeled the temporal and environmental factors influencing D. suzukii activity. We found that this pest established high levels within 2 yr of being detected, with peak fly activity continuing to increase. Fly activity timing and abundance were predicted by the annual number of days below 0 degrees C, the number of winter and spring days above 10 degrees C, and by the fly activity in the preceding year, providing support for overwintering in our region. We monitored larval infestation for 4 yr at these same sites and found a moderate positive correlation between larvae in fruit and adults in traps. Finally, we developed a generalized additive model to predict D. suzukii fly capture throughout the season based on relevant environmental factors and examined the relative timing and magnitude of activity under varying winter and spring temperature conditions.

Incidence of R. phoenicis was compared across sampling sites, season and proximity to natural vegetation; and subjected to a multiple linear regression with temperature, relative humidity and rainfall. Incidence of R. phoenicis was highest in Masaka district in the western side of River Nile in Lake Victoria Crescent agro-ecological zone; and absent in Mayuge and Bugiri district at the eastern side of River Nile in Lake Victoria Crescent agro-ecological zone.

Predicting the ecological impacts of hot events should incorporate both immediate and potential carry-over effects in different intensities of heat waves. Previous studies suggested that higher heat dose in early life stage of insect generally decreased immediate survival and depressed adult reproduction through carry-over effects, or unchanged adult performance through recovery effects. However, our previous study showed a different pattern, in which longer heat exposures in larval stage did not always decrease but sometimes increase the subsequent adult maturation success in the diamondback moth. We speculated that it might be another important pattern in the carry-over effects vs. heat dose, and conducted experiments using a global pest, Plutella xylostella. Our present results suggested that heat exposures in early life stage reduced the immediate survival and produced general declines with significant zigzag fluctuating patterns in subsequent body size and reproduction as exposure durations increased. The similar patterns were also validated in other insect taxa and other stresses by reanalyzing the experiment data from literatures.

Information on the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the flight performance of B. odoriphaga is crucial for understanding the pest's ability to disperse and migrate. In this study, the effects of sex and air temperature on the flight performance of B. odoriphaga imagoes were assessed by tethering individual imagoes to computerized flight mills for a 10-h experiment. The results showed that the percentage of imagoes that flew a particular distance gradually decreased as flight distance increased. The percentage of imagoes was significantly higher for males than females when the flight distance was <300 m. Sex and air temperature significantly affected average flight time (which ranged from 14.6 to 68.3 min) and average flight distance (which ranged from 10.4 to 107.2 m), but did not significantly affect average flight speed (which ranged from 3.8 to 6.4 m/min). For both females and males, the average flight distance and flight time were shortest at 18 degrees C and longest at 22 degrees C; the interaction between air temperature and sex was not significant.

In Colorado, their life history is closely tied to the development of winter wheat, where they are present in the field from crop planting in late September through harvest in early June. In order to withstand winter months, these mites are able to survive cold temperatures. However, the mechanisms of cold hardening and their temperature limits are unknown. This research documents the seasonal supercooling points of the brown wheat mite. Their seasonal average supercooling point stayed consistent throughout the year, never varying more than a degree from the overall average supercooling point of -17 degrees C. The greatest variation in supercooling point was seen in the spring, during which supercooling point temperatures ranged from -9.2 to -25.5 degrees C. We also documented the upper and lower lethal temperatures for the brown wheat mite. When comparing small nymphs to large nymph and adult stages, small nymphs were slightly more cold tolerant (lethal temperature estimates required to kill 99% of the population [LT99] were -30.8 and -30.6 degrees C, respectively), but less heat tolerant (LT99 was 50 and 56 degrees C, respectively).",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-0493,1938-291X,2019,10.1093/jee/toz157,WOS:000488103600061

In the field, we sampled ripe and unripe chili pepper fruits in three different plant strata. In the laboratory, we established colonies of the S. dulce and we recorded the duration, viability, morphology of each life stage, and number of larval instars. We conducted experiments to evaluate insect reproduction, whereby we registered the pre-oviposition and oviposition period, daily oviposition rate, and sex ratio. From these results, we estimated the reproductive success of S. dulce through the intrinsic population growth rate. The higher occurrence of S. dulce was in unripe fruits with no difference between plant strata. Egg stage lasted 4 days with 94% viability, and larval phase lasted on average 10.72 days and presented four instars with viability of 66.6%. Pupal stage lasted 9.61 days with viability of 94.73%.

Here, we aim at disentangling the effects of climate, land-use, and geographical drivers on aphid abundance and phenology in France, at a regional scale and over the last 40 years. We used aerial data obtained from suction traps between 1978 and 2015 on five aphid species varying in their degree of specialization to legumes, along with climate, legume crop area and geographical data. Effects of environmental and geographical variables on aphid annual abundance and spring migration dates were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. We found that within the last four decades, aphids have advanced their spring migration by a month, mostly due to the increase in temperature early in the year, and their abundance decreased by half on average, presumably in response to a combination of factors. The influence of legume crop area decreased with the degree of specialization of the aphid species to such crops. The effect of geographical variation was high even when controlling for environmental variables, suggesting that many other spatially structured processes act on aphid population characteristics. Multifactorial analyses helped to partition the effects of different global change drivers.

The current study first evaluated the effects of two variable-temperature treatments [high-temperature-variation (HT) treatments and mild-temperature-variation (MT) treatments] on the life-history traits of a maternal generation (F-0) of Rhopalosiphum padi, a serious global pest, using a constant normal-temperature (NT) treatment as a control. Following this, the life-history traits of the offspring generation (F-1) under the NT, MT and HT scenarios were analysed. 3. The total developmental duration of the aphid F-0 generation was significantly shortened by MT treatments, while it was significantly increased by HT treatments. Adult longevity and the fecundity of F-0 were significantly decreased by HT treatments compared with those in the MT and NT treatments, whereas no significant difference was found between the latter two treatments. The HT treatments applied to the F-0 generation significantly prolonged the total developmental duration of the F-1 generation. The offspring adult longevity was not affected by the mothers' temperature experience. The offspring fecundity was significantly increased when the F-0 generation experienced MT treatments. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was significantly decreased when the F-0 generation experienced an HT scenario.

In this study, ten mixed-sex adults were exposed on 200 g of either rice flour or brown rice, and populations were assessed after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months at 22, 27, or 32 degrees C. At 22 degrees C, the number of adults, pupae and larvae on rice flour and brown rice remained low throughout the 12-month storage period. At 27 degrees C, the number of adults on rice flour increased to a maximum at 8 months, while adult populations on brown rice remained relatively constant from 2 to 10 months, with few pupae or larvae in the samples. At 32 degrees C, adult populations on rice flour and brown rice were constant after month 2, with low numbers of pupae and larvae. Adult predation could have accounted for low numbers of pupae and larvae. Using the original 10-month data, populations were projected for an additional 14 months to predict population patterns. Adult numbers showed an increase over time at all temperatures on rice flour and brown rice at 22 degrees C but numbers seemed to stabilize at 27 and 32 degrees C. For both diets at 27 and 32 degrees C, projected pupae and larvae numbers remained steady but low compared to adults. However, populations would not be expected to increase indefinitely because at some point the resources would become limited and populations would crash or decline.

Kernels of six wheat varieties namely, Danda'a, Digalu, ET-13-A2, Kakaba, Millennium, and Pavon-76 were examined over a period of 90 d. Significant interactions were detected between wheat varieties and storage temperature for progeny emergence, percentage of insect damaged kernels, grain weight loss, and amount of powder produced per gram of wheat. Kernels of Danda'a, infested with S. oryzae at 30 degrees C exhibited significantly lower mean progeny counts (13.3 live insects), lower percentage of grain weight loss (4.2%) and insect-damaged kernels (6.4%), and powder production (1.5 mg/g). Kernel weight and hardness index were negatively associated with percentage of insect damaged kernels and grain weight loss. Kernel diameter was positively associated with both of percentage of insect damaged kernels and grain weight loss. Wheat varieties with high Zeleny sedimentation values had lower percentage of insect-damaged kernels and grain weight loss. These results indicated that kernel weight, hardness index, and protein content are predominant factors contributing to wheat resistance against S. granarius and S. oryzae.

Our study seeks to establish the distribution and host-plant relationship of ACT across citrus production areas in Kenya. We also modelled the risk of spread using the maximum entropy modelling algorithm with known occurrence data. Our results infer that ACT is widely distributed and causes severe damage to four alternative host plants belonging to the family Rutaceae. The adults, immature stages (eggs and nymphs), galls and the percentage of infested leaves were significantly higher in shaded than unshaded trees. However, adult ACTs preferred Kenyan highlands to Victoria Lake and coastal regions. The average area under the curve of the model predictions was 0.97, indicating an optimal model performance. The environmental variables that most influenced the prediction were the precipitation of wettest quarter, precipitation of wettest month, mean diurnal range, temperature seasonality and mean temperature of the coldest quarter. The current prediction of ACT exceeded its existing range, especially in the Western, Nyanza, Central, Rift valley and Eastern regions of Kenya. The model predicted a contraction of suitable habitats for a potential spread in 2040 with an inland shift to higher altitudes in the cooler regions.

Climate changes (particularly high temperatures in late winter in Bangladesh) coincide with upsurge in outbreaks of this pest. We generated a statistical model using more than two decades of data to show that increased temperatures associate with this upsurge. Over the 22-year model period, leaffolder populations in November increased significantly, corresponding to significant monthly temperature trends (but not rainfall) over the same period. Utilizing a linear model, we find that increasing temperature interacts with the amount of rainfall. With the variable month as a proxy for all seasonal effects affecting leaffolder abundance, the model reveals a significant correspondence with climate variations compared to average conditions; specifically, the model predicts that increasing maximum temperatures will lead to more leaffolder, while more rain will decrease their abundance.

Development time decreased with increasing temperature from 17.2 to 27.5 degrees C; at 29.3 degrees C no parasitoid completed development. Temperatures below 17.2 degrees C triggered a facultative diapause in both species, and this cold temperature response varied among populations of different origin: South Korean populations of G. brasiliensis and L. japonica entered diapause at 17.2 degrees C, whereas only a proportion of their Chinese counterparts entered diapause at the same temperature. No significant differences in offspring survival and fecundity were detected between populations in the mid-temperature range. However, fecundity at 15.9 degrees C was higher for South Korean populations of G. brasiliensis and L. japonica compared with their Chinese counterparts, suggesting that the host location and oviposition behavior of the searching females was less affected by the cold temperature and/or their eggs had better cold hardiness.

However, in some species, the behavioral patterns recorded in artificial conditions contrast greatly with observed wild-type behavioral rhythms. In this study, we identify the determinants of daily activity rhythms of the soft and stone fruit pest Drosophila suzukii. The impact of gender, space, social housing, temperature, light, fly morph, and the circadian clock on D. suzukii locomotor rhythms was investigated. Assays were performed under artificial laboratory conditions or more natural semifield conditions to identify how these factors affected daily locomotor behavior. Daily locomotor activity patterns collected under semifield conditions varied very little between the various sex and social condition combinations. However, in lab-based assays, individual and group-housed males often exhibited divergent activity patterns, with more prominent hyperactivity at light/dark transitions. In contrast, hyperactivity responses were suppressed under lab protocols mimicking summer conditions for groups of females and mixed-sex groups. Moreover, when environmental cues were removed, flies held in groups displayed stronger rhythmicity than individual flies. Thus, social interactions can reinforce circadian behavior and resist hyperactivity responses in D. suzukii. Fly morph appeared to have little impact on behavioral pattern, with winter and summer morph flies displaying similar activity profiles under April semifield and laboratory mimic environmental conditions. In conclusion, separate and combined effects of light, temperature, circadian clock function, and social interactions were apparent in the daily activity profiles of D. suzukii. When groups of female or mixed-sex flies were used, implementation of matching photoperiods and realistic daily temperature gradients in the lab was sufficient to re-create behavioral patterns observed in summer semifield settings.

Mediterranean fruit fly can cause up to 100% crop loss in susceptible fruit. In order to formulate best management practices, it is critical to understand how Mediterranean fruit fly overwinters in a given geographical location and bridge the gap between autumn and spring populations. In this study, we evaluated the overwintering potential of Mediterranean fruit fly immature and adult stages in two locations in Perth Hills, Western Australia. We also monitored wild adult Mediterranean fruit fly populations for 2 yr. Adults were present year-round with captures very low in winter to early spring relative to summer and autumn. Field experiments revealed that immature stages in apples (eggs/first instar) and soil (pupae) remained viable in winter, emerging as adults at the onset of warmer weather in spring. In field cages, adults survived 72-110 d, and female laid viable eggs when offered citrus fruit, though only 1-6% eggs survived to emerge as adults. Adults survived longer in field cages when offered live citrus branch.The findings suggest that all Mediterranean fruit fly life stages can survive through mild winter, and surviving adults, eggs in the fruit and/or pupae in the soil are the sources of new population that affect the deciduous fruit crops in Perth.

However, phenology-temperature relationships are important for understanding patterns of ecosystem disturbance, especially under projected climate warming. Here, we use a multiyear trapping study to test the hypothesis that spruce beetle flight synchrony, timing, and fitness traits (body size) are affected by variation in regional temperature and physiography. Large quantities of co-colonizing scolytines (Polygraphus convexifrons) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) and predatory beetles ( Thanasimus undulatus) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) that may affect D. rufipennis populations also responded to spruce beetle synthetic pheromone lures. Relationships between flight patterns and environmental conditions were also analyzed for these species. The winter of 2018 was warmer and drier than winter 2017 and was associated with earlier flight for both scolytine species across most sites. The most important environmental factor driving D. rufipennis flight phenology was accumulated growing degree-days, with delayed flight cessation under warmer conditions and larger beetles following a warm winter. Flight was consistently more synchronous under colder growing season conditions for all species, but synchrony was not associated with winter temperatures. Warmer-than-average years promoted earlier flight of D. rufipennis and associated species, and less synchronous, prolonged flight across the region. Consequently, climate warming may be associated with earlier and potentially extended biotic pressure for spruce trees in the Rocky Mountain region, and flight phenology of multiple scolytines is plastic in response to thermal conditions.",no,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0046-225X,1938-2936,2019,10.1093/ee/nvz067,WOS:000493086500025

However, there is no information about the role these limiting and regulating factors play. Aphid densities, citrus phenology, and associated predators that overwinter in the crop were monitored weekly throughout two flush growth periods (February to July) in four clementine mandarin groves; relationships between these parameters and environmental variables (temperature and precipitation) were studied. Our results show exponential increase in aphid infestation levels to coincide with citrus phenological stages B3 and B4; shoots offer more space and nutritional resources for colony growth at these stages. Duration of these phenological stages, which was mediated by mean temperature, seems to importantly determine the severity of aphid infestations in the groves. Among those studied, the micro-coccinellids, mostly Scymnus species, were the only group of predators with the ability to efficiently regulate aphid populations. These natural enemies had the highest temporal and spatial demographic stability.

In that sense, passive solar heating is a promising alternative compared to classic methods such as fossil fuels that are cost impacted and harmful to the environment. The current work is devoted to the study of the effect of a solar heating system using black plastic sleeves filled with water on the microclimate, tomato yield and the dynamic population of the tomato key pest, Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) in canarian greenhouses. The results show that the use of this heating system, improves the nighttime temperature inside the green-house by 3.1 degrees C and reduce by 10% the relative humidity compared to the control greenhouse. This microclimate improvement has a positive impact on the tomato production. It has increased by 35% compared to the control greenhouse.

Tomato, one of the most important vegetables in the world, is grown mostly outdoors, and may be severely impacted by CC. Farmers cultivating tomatoes need to adapt to an increase in the potential for outbreaks of pests favoured by CC and disruption of biological control, yet, no attempt has been made to simultaneously evaluate CC effects on a crop-pest-natural enemy system for tomato or any other crop. Here, we modelled the suitability of areas equipped with irrigation facilities (AEI) in 2050 for tomato, the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a mite pest of tomato among more than 200 crops, and its key predator Phytoseiulus persimilis. We evaluated the suitability of AEI for tomato production under a 1.6 degrees C warming by 2050, within the targets of the Paris agreement. Projections show that climatic conditions become unsuitable for tomato production on 30%-100% of AEI for seven out of the 29 top tomato producing countries of the world. Model predictions suggest that two-spotted spider mite potential for outbreaks would increase substantially in nine countries in Europe, Africa and Asia, while biological control failures would occur globally. Model results have a significant relationship with growth rates for the three species measured in outdoor experiments, and farmer/expert perceptions on two-spotted spider mite outbreak severity captured via interviews. The expansion of AEI in other agricultural areas in the sub-Saharan Africa may offset losses of suitable land. However, several nations in the Middle East and South Asia with prevalent small scale agriculture would experience devastating impacts because of the unsuitability of conditions for tomato production and the potential increase in two-spotted spider mite outbreaks.",no,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1748-9326,NA,2019,10.1088/1748-9326/ab3313,WOS:000481537200002

The objective of this work was to determine the life-history parameters of R. indica at constant temperatures, estimate its thermal requirements [threshold temperature (Tb) and thermal constant (K)] and also compare its life table parameters between sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis. The life tables were constructed on leaflets of Adonidia merrillii at 15, 20, 24, 27, 30 and 34 degrees C and 65% RH and a 12-h photoperiod. The longevity and the number of laid eggs of non-copulated adult females were evaluated at 27 degrees C. Raoiella indica had complete development, from egg to adult, only at 20, 24, 27 and 30 degrees C. At 15 degrees C, the eggs did not hatch, and at 34 degrees C, the mites survived only until the larval stage. For sexual reproduction, the optimal temperature was 27 degrees C, under which the reproductive parameters were higher. The reproductive parameters for sexual reproduction were higher than those for parthenogenesis. The Tb was 14.79 degrees C, and the thermal constant was 208.33 degree days.

The ability to tolerate climatic diversity is uncommon among insects, and understanding the population phenology drivers of such species across different parts of their range will be critical for their management. Here, we determined the role of temperature versus fruit availability on the population phenology of Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni. Using a field site located at the subtropical/temperate interface, with host fruits continuously available, we monitored the development times and abundance of B. tryoni, a species which has invaded temperate Australia from the tropics. From fruit samples held at ambient and controlled conditions, the abundance of emerging flies was highly variable among collection dates, but the variance did not reflect the observed changes in temperature. For most samples, the survival rate of flies in a field site was lower than predicted by a day-degree population model fitted with mean daily field temperatures. The development time of the immature stage in the field was prolonged, presumably due to cooler ambient conditions, but the fitted day-degree population model consistently over-predicted estimated development times. Our results indicate that at the subtropical/temperate interface, the decline in B. tryoni populations during winter is only partly driven by temperature and host availability.

In Indian subcontinent and Southern Europe, the pest causes serious damage to tomato crop. High migrating ability of H. armigera is expected to threaten more area cultivated under this crop. It is therefore important to understand the development of this pest on tomato to predict its phenology well in advance in order to manage it efficiently. Keeping that in view, the development and mortality of immature stages of H. armigera were studied inside plant growth chamber with six different alternating temperatures (Max/Min degrees C) viz. 25:10, 25:13, 25:16, 30:10, 30:13, and 30:16 degrees C with 14:10h photoperiod. Development of all immature stages quickened with increasing alternating temperatures. Tomato-fed larval stage suffered heavy mortality which ranged from 69 to 85% and completed development in 47.4-31.6days with rising alternating temperatures. The development data of H. armigera immature stages were fitted into various models like simple linear model, Ikemoto-Takai model and Kontodimas nonlinear model. Among linear models, Ikemoto-Takai model estimated lower threshold temperatures of egg, larva, and pupa viz. 9.9, 7.8, and 12.3 degrees C, respectively. Daily mean temperatures falling below these threshold values likely to be fatal for immature stages of H. armigera.

While laboratory estimates of CBB development under constant conditions exist, they have not been applied under the heterogeneous environmental conditions that characterize many coffee-growing regions. We measured CBB development times and abundance in commercial coffee farms across an elevational gradient on Hawai'i Island and applied thermal accumulation models from previous laboratory studies to test their fit to field data. Artificial lures were used to infest coffee berries at five farms ranging in elevation from 279-792 m, and weather variables were monitored at macro (farm-level) and micro (branch-level) scales. CBB development was followed in the field from the time of initial berry infestation by the founding female through the development of F1 mature adults. Mean development time from egg to adult across all sites was 38.5 +/- 3.46 days, while the mean time required for the completion of a full life cycle (from time of infestation to presence of mature F1 females) was 50.9 +/- 3.35 days.

Consistent with its broader distribution range, the former species is less susceptible to low rearing temperatures, develops faster and has a larger body mass than the latter. However, C. rubiginosa seems to be less adapted to late-season conditions as a short-day photoperiod accelerates its immature development to a lesser extent than it does in C. stigmatica, which nevertheless results in greater larval mortality and slightly but significantly smaller adults. By contrast, in C. stigmatica, which is more likely to encounter late-season conditions due to its slower life cycle, short-day acceleration of development is achieved at no cost to survivorship and final body mass.

In order to conducted life cycle assessment, first, the results of each site were analyzed separately, and since there were not differences among the impact categories and indices in different sites, the average for the results of the three sites are being presented. Results show that decreased insecticides application in transgenic cultivars lowers the need for labor, machineries, and fuel, thereby contributing to reduction in use of energy and greenhouse gases emission from construction, transportation and application of inputs during cultivation. Furthermore, most investigated impact categories were obtained high for Tarom Molaii and Khazar and less for three transgenic lines. In addition, the most important categories were non-renewable energy, global warming, aquatic eutrophication, aquatic acidification, terrestrial acid/nutri, land occupation, terrestrial ecotoxicity, ozone layer depletion, ionizing radiation, respiratory inorganics, respiratory organics, cumulative energy demand, ecological footprint, greenhouse gas protocol, water footprint, carcinogens and non-carcinogens.

Relative abundance is determined by physiological date of first detection and air temperatures the previous winter. Date of first detection of flies does not determine date of fruit infestation. The level of fruit infestation is determined by year, fly pressure, and insecticide application frequency. Frequency of insecticide application is determined by production system. Non-crop wild fruit and predation influences fly pressure; increased wild fruit abundance results in increased fly pressure. Increased predation rate reduces fly pressure, but only at high abundance of flies, or when high levels of wild fruit are present along field edges. Male sex ratio might be declining over the seven years. Action thresholds were developed from samples of 92 fields from 2012-2017 that related cumulative adult male trap capture to the following week likelihood of fruit infestation. A two-parameter gamma density function describing this probability was used to develop a risk-based gradient action threshold system.

J,"Wang, XG; Kacar, G; Daane, KM",Temporal Dynamics of Host Use by Drosophila suzukii in California's San Joaquin Valley: Implications for Area-Wide Pest Management,"A major challenge to the area-wide management of Drosophila suzukii is understanding the fly's host use and temporal dynamics, which may dictate local movement patterns. We determined D. suzukii's seasonal host use in California's San Joaquin Valley by sampling common crop and non-crop fruits in a temporal sequence of fruit ripening. We then evaluated the suitability of selected fruits as hosts. Drosophila suzukii emerged from both intact and damaged cherries during the cooler, early season period. Fly density remained low through the hot spring-summer period and re-surged as temperatures lowered in fall when the fly did not cause damage to intact peach, nectarine, plum, pear, grape, pomegranate, apple, persimmon and citrus (in order of ripening) but did emerge from the damaged fruits of these crops. The fly also emerged from two ornamental fruits (loquats and cactus) but was not found on wild plum and two endemic wild fruits (buckthorn and bitter berry). Drosophila suzukii completed development (egg to adult) on cactus, mandarin carpel, pomegranate seed, wild plum and buckthorn at survival rates similar to cherry (51.2-68.8%), whereas it had a lower survival rate on bitter cherry (33.2%), table grape (31.5%), raisin grape (26.5%), and wine grape (4.5%). The high acidity levels of grapes negatively affected the fly's fitness. Among 10 cherry cultivars, survival rate was not affected by sugar content, but it decreased with increasing egg density per gram of fruit. Results suggest that in California's San Joaquin Valley, the early season crops are most vulnerable, summer fruits ripen during a period of low pest pressure, and late season fruits, when damaged, serve to sustain D. suzukii's populations in this region.",no,,,,,INSECTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2075-4450,NA,2019,10.3390/insects10070206,WOS:000478764600013

A highly plastic species may survive and reproduce in more diverse environments, thereby supporting establishment and colonization. We focused on plasticity in the circadian rhythm of activity, which can favour species coexistence in invasion, for the invasive species Drosophila suzukii, which is expected to be a weaker direct competitor than other Drosophila species of the resident community. We compared the circadian rhythms of the locomotor activity in adults and the expression of clock genes in response to temperature in the invasive D. suzukii and the resident Drosophila melanogaster. We showed that D. suzukii is active in a narrower range of temperatures than D. melanogaster and that the activities of the two species overlap during the day, regardless of the temperature. Both species are diumal and exhibit rhythmic activity at dawn and dusk, with a much lower activity at dawn for D. suzukii females. Our results show that the timeless and clock genes are good candidates to explain the plastic response that is observed in relation to temperature.

Predicting where crop pests and diseases can occur, both now and in the future under different climate change scenarios, is a major challenge for crop management. One solution is to estimate the fundamental thermal niche of the pest/disease to indicate where establishment is possible. Here, we develop methods for estimating and displaying the fundamental thermal niche of pests and pathogens and apply these methods to Huanglongbing (HLB), a vector-borne disease that is currently threatening the citrus industry worldwide. 2. We derive a suitability metric based on a mathematical model of HLB transmission between tree hosts and its vector Diaphorina citri, and incorporate the effect of temperature on vector traits using data from laboratory experiments performed at different temperatures. We validate the model using data on the historical range of HLB. 3. Our model predicts that transmission of HLB is possible between 16 and 33 degrees C with peak transmission at similar to 25 degrees C. The greatest uncertainty in our suitability metric is associated with the mortality of the vectors at peak transmission, and fecundity at the edges of the thermal range, indicating that these parameters need further experimental work. 4. We produce global thermal niche maps by plotting how many months each location is suitable for establishment of the pest/disease. This analysis reveals that the highest suitability for HLB occurs near the equator in large citrus-producing regions, such as Brazil and South-East Asia. Within the Northern Hemisphere, the Iberian peninsula and California are HLB suitable for up to 7 months of the year and are free of HLB currently. 5. Policy implications. We create a thermal niche map which indicates the places at greatest risk of establishment should a crop disease or pest enter these regions. This indicates where surveillance should be focused to prevent establishment. Our mechanistic method can be used to predict new areas for Huanglongbing transmission under different climate change scenarios and is easily adapted to other vector-borne diseases and crop pests.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0021-8901,1365-2664,2019,10.1111/1365-2664.13455,WOS:000473853900001

A multidimensional field-based surveillance was conducted in two seasons (24 months), July-June of each season (2015/2016 - season 1 and 2016/2017 - season 2) using sex-pheromone-baited traps and Thermocron i-Buttons to identify key determinants of population abundance of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L., across spatial horticultural hotspots of Botswana. The moth is a notorious global brassica pest. Pearson's product moment correlation matrix showed month of the year (M), mean temperature (T-mean) and maximum temperature (T-max) as positively correlated (p < 0.001) to number of moths (N), while minimum temperature (T-min), minimum relative humidity (RHmin), mean relative humidity (RHmean), maximum relative humidity (RHmax) and host plant (h) were negatively correlated (p < 0.001) to N. Using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) data-mining techniques, two models were developed: (a) M5P decision-tree algorithm associated with nine linear models (LMs) and (b) principal component analysis (PCA) based on four principal components. Both approaches identified M as the major predictor of moth abundance, followed by h and farming region (R). However, R was a function of T-max (positive auto-correlation) and RHmax (negative auto-correlation).

J,"Zhao, F; Xing, K; Hoffmann, AA; Ma, CS",The importance of timing of heat events for predicting the dynamics of aphid pest populations,"BACKGROUND Heatwaves are increasing in frequency and there is growing interest in their impact on pest organisms. Previous work indicates that effects depend on the timing of the stress event, whose impact needs to be characterized across the full set of developmental stages and exposure periods of an organism. Here, we undertake such a detailed assessment using heat stress (20-35 degrees C diurnal cycle) across the nymph and adult stages of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius). RESULTS Stress-related mortality increased with stress duration at all stages; effects were less severe at the late nymphal stage. Effects on longevity adults after stress showed a complex pattern with nymphal heat stress, increasing with stress duration at the late nymphal stage, but decreasing with duration at the early nymphal stage. Longevity was also reduced by adult stress although to a lesser extent, and patterns were not connected to duration. Post-stress productivity decreased following adult and nymphal stress and the decrease tended to be correlated with stress duration. The rate of offspring production was more affected by adult stress than nymphal stress. Productivity and longevity effects, when combined, showed that the largest effect of heat stress occurred at the early nymphal stage. CONCLUSION These findings highlight the complex ways in which heat stress at a particular life stage influences later fitness and they also emphasize the importance of considering multiple fitness components when assessing stress effects.

Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) has invaded many regions in China, causing enormous ecological and economic losses. We aimed to explore the trend and potential of diffusion by researching the thermal survival limits of S. noctilio. We measured the supercooling point (SCP), critical thermal temperature (CTmax), high lethal temperature (HLT) and low lethal temperature (LLT) for S. noctilio population in China and assessed life stage-related variation in thermal tolerance. Moreover, we determined the temperature tolerance range of S. noctilio and identified the temperature parameters for its potential invasive distribution risk analysis. The SCP of adults was -11.78 +/- 0.67 (mean +/- SEM), the CTmax was 37.67 +/- 0.54, and those of larvae were -20.77 +/- 0.44 and 40.53 +/- 0.27, respectively. The LLT increased with exposure time, and the HLT was generally near 43 degrees C. S. noctilio adults can tolerate higher temperatures than larvae, and the larvae showed high resistance to cold temperature. We calculated several temperature indexes based on our results, such as the lower temperature threshold (DV0) at -2.7 degrees C, the upper temperature threshold (DV3) at 31 degrees C, the temperature threshold for both heat stress (TTHS) at 35 degrees C and cold stress (TTCS) at -32.5 degrees C. We observed that, S. noctilio was not resistant to high temperatures, its CTmax is slightly lower than the lethal temperature, and the adults were more tolerant than larvae.

J,"Brent, CS; Spurgeon, DW",Reproductive Development of Lygus hesperus (Hemiptera: Miridae) Adults Under Constant and Variable Temperatures,"As water for agriculture becomes less available in the semi-arid western United States, alternative irrigation strategies such as deficit irrigation may be necessary for continued crop production. Alternative irrigation practices in cotton (Gossypium spp. [Malvales: Valvaceae]) can result in episodic drought stress that alters temperature profiles within the crop canopy. These altered temperatures may influence populations of important pests such as Lygus hesperus Knight. Field studies often associate lower population densities of L. hesperus with limited irrigation. Recent studies of the thermal ecology of L. hesperus egg and nymphal development have demonstrated only subtle effects of the high, variable temperatures typical of moderate drought stress in cotton. However, influences of these conditions on L. hesperus adult reproductive development have not been studied. The reproductive development of L. hesperus adults was examined under constant (+/- 0.2 degrees C) and variable (+/- 8 degrees C) regimes at a low (15 degrees C), moderate (22 degrees C), and high (29 degrees C) daily mean temperatures. No developmental differences were demonstrated between temperature regimes under moderate or high temperatures. At the low temperature, only the times to the occurrence of eggs, filled medial accessory glands, and filling seminal vesicles were shorter under variable regime, compared with the constant temperature. These results suggest that temporary, episodic increases in crop canopy temperatures caused by moderate drought stress are unlikely to impact L. hesperus population growth, and may only promote short-term displacement of adults into adjacent crops with preferable conditions.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1536-2442,2250-2645,2019,10.1093/jisesa/iez066,WOS:000472811700002

For R. pomonella, relatively high winter mean minimum temperature, low elevation, and developed land-cover were the top variables positively related to fly abundance. In contrast, for R. indifferens, the top variables related to greater fly abundance were high Hargreaves climatic moisture and annual heat-moisture deficits (indication of drier habitats), high host plant abundance, and developed land-cover.

The Chinese citrus fly, Bactrocera minax (Enderlein) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is one of the most destructive citrus pest in China and Bhutan. This species overwinters as diapausing pupae in the soil before emerging as adults in the spring. In this study, B. minax collected from three representative geographical populations in China (Guizhou, Hubei, and Shaanxi) was used to conduct LDT experiments under laboratory conditions. Emergence data collected from pupae exposed to 10 constant temperatures was used to estimate the LDT and DDs required to complete pupal development for the three populations. The results show that LDT and DDs values for the Hubei and Shaanxi population are 11.9 degrees C, 447.3 DDs and 11.5 degrees C, 511.3 DDs, respectively. However, the geographic variation in pupal developmental rates was not statistically significant between the two populations. In addition, the Guizhou population was identified as a mixture of B. minax and B. tsuneonis (Miyake).

A model was then built to fit temperature data of cold fronts from 2001 to 2016 and to calculate potential mortalities along latitudes. Isothermal lines delineated at 90% mortality were defined as the northern limits. Modeling results suggested that A. lagerstroemiae nymphs collected in summer could tolerate heat; however, they were more susceptible to cold temperatures. Laboratory assays suggested that cold tolerance of A. lagerstroemiae nymphs varied from summer to winter. For example, SCP of nymphs collected in summer was higher than those collected in fall (-21 vs. -27 degrees C), and the exposure time leading to Lt(90) at 0 degrees C was also different, which were 8 versus 50 h comparing nymphs collected in summer versus fall.

Establishment of first instars of Lymantria depends on larvae surviving long enough to disperse and finding suitable hosts. The survival and development of newly hatched Lymantria larvae from nine geographic populations at seven temperatures (1-30 degrees C) held without food, with summer foliage of a preferred or conifer host was determined. There was considerable variation both within and among the Lymantria populations in the survival of larvae at different temperatures when held with and without food. Without food survival declined from about a month at 5 degrees C to a few days at 30 degrees C, following a typical enzymatic kinetic rate function. At 1 degrees C larval survival was less than at 5 degrees C likely because the larvae were susceptible to freezing. Larvae from the one L. monacha population fed and gained weight on the summer foliage, particularly on the conifer, at 10-15 degrees C but < 20% survived for 14 d at 20-30 degrees C. The newly hatched L. dispar larvae from all eight populations fed (at 10-30 degrees C) and developed (at 15-30 degrees C) on the summer foliage of one or both of the hosts.

In this study, we analyzed the temporal fluctuation of sexually mature females of A. ludens populations with respect to the availability of commercial hosts and climatic factors, as well as population data of females over an extensive citrus area in northeastern Mexico. The numbers of mature females were treated as proportions and analyzed with generalized linear mixed models with a binomial error distribution. Results revealed positive effects on proportions of mature females when commercial hosts (Valencia orange and grapefruit) were available at both medium and high levels, whereas negative effects on proportions were observed when commercial hosts were scarcely available. Monthly analyses indicated positive trends on proportion in March, April, October, and November, whereas negative trends were seen in January and June. A low capture of mature females during the late summer and the onset of winter suggests transitional phenological processes across the year. Overall, no relationships were observed between proportions with temperature and the total number of females; however, a positive relationship was observed between proportion and rainfall. These findings provide insight into the reproductive phenology of A. ludens with practical implications for fruit sampling, as well as for the autocidal or chemical control in an areawide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) approach in citrus-growing areas of northeastern Mexico.",yes,field,abundance,,,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0013-8703,1570-7458,2019,10.1111/eea.12800,WOS:000477015000002

The present study aimed to examine the growth and development of leaf feeding Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera) reared on groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) grown under different climate change treatments under open top chambers (OTC's) at University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur, Karnataka Significantly lower leaf nitrogen, higher carbon, C: N ratio, phenols and tannins was observed in the groundnut foliage grown under eCO(2) conditions. This alteration in food quality in elevated conditions significantly affected the growth parameters of S. litura in the form of increased food consumption, increased larval weight and more faecal matter production due to extended larval and pupal duration. This resulted in reduced fecundity, particularly in the population raised under eCO(2 )conditions compared to ambient conditions. Further, the insect larva showed increased approximate digestibility and relative consumption rate under eCO(2) condition coupled with reduced efficiency of conversion of ingested food. As a result, the relative growth rate was decreased under eCO(2) conditions.

J,"Pernek, M; Lackovic, N; Lukic, I; Zoric, N; Matosevic, D","Outbreak of Orthotomicus erosus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) on Aleppo Pine in the Mediterranean Region in Croatia","Background and Purpose: Orthotomicus erosus, Mediterranean pine engraver, is widely distributed across the Mediterranean and southern Europe, Asia and North Africa. It is considered as secondary pest found on recently dead or felled trees, but can also attack weakened living trees. In high population levels this species can attack healthy trees and cause their dieback. Severe outbreaks occur after dry periods, or after fire in adjoining stands in warmer parts of the Mediterranean region, while this scenario has never happened in Croatia up to now. Bark beetles are important forest pests which have already been researched and discussed in relation to climate change, indicating that the predicted increase in temperature would lead to higher survival rates and faster development, thus directly influencing their population dynamics. Increase in temperature may stimulate changes in insects' rate of development, voltinism, population density, size, genetic composition, extent of host plant exploitation, longitudinal and latitudinal distribution. Since climate conditions might have changed in the last few years as predicted in the Mediterranean region, the aim of our research is to document the first outbreak with high population levels of O. erosus in Croatia. Materials and Methods: The extent of dieback was evaluated by counting trees with dieback symptoms on diagonal transects plotted through each of 33 forest management sections of Marjan Forest Park (Split). Trunk sections from several trees with early stage symptoms were collected for further laboratory analysis, which consisted of incubation phase and subsequent morphological identification. During regular yearly surveys in forests of Croatia, the pest was observed on several sites and damages were recorded for both years 2017 and 2018. The records were entered into a map using QGIS version 3.2.1-Bonn. Spatial data was downloaded from DIVA-GIS server. Monitoring efforts were initiated in affected areas where 13 flight barrier pheromone traps (Theyson (R)) equipped with pheromone lure Erosowit (R) (Witasek, Austria) were set-up in late March in state-owned and privately owned forests across Dalmatia. Catches in the traps were collected and O. erosus adults were counted on a weekly basis in order to identify the abundance of the pest in monitored sites, as well as to obtain the first information about population dynamics and to assess voltinism. Results: On-site survey and the evaluation of dieback extent included sampling of 5% of all trees in Marjan Forest Park, and the results showed that 23% of all trees in the forest park were affected by dieback symptoms. Visual examination of trunks, branches and bark showed symptoms of bark beetle infestation, while preliminary on-site examination of the observed adults pointed out to O. erosus. After two weeks in controlled conditions, bark beetle adults started to emerge from trunk sections which were placed in several mesh cages for incubation. Morphological identification by using stereomicroscope and the key for European bark beetles resulted in identification of O. erosus species. Over the course of the year 2017 one more site was reported to be infested with O. erosus, and eight additional sites were reported over the course of year 2018. In total, 446 ha were reported as infested, varying in intensity, in several different management units of state-owned and privately owned forests. The total number of trapped beetles in pheromone traps varied largely among sites. Our data indicate that several generations (at least 5 generations per year) were present in the year 2018. Conclusions: Sudden surge in observed damages, as well as the number of beetles trapped during monitoring, in years 2017 and 2018 throughout Aleppo pine forests in Dalmatia are the first record of O. erosus outbreak in Croatia. O. erosus is native to Croatia and so far it has been considered only as a minor pest whose outbreaks have never been recorded. Drought intensity and frequency and aridification trends in the research area (Dalmatia, Croatia) cause cumulative stress to trees and have increased O. erosus occurrence. O. erosus is expected to exhibit increased voltinism, better overwintering performance and earlier spring flights. Our first results confirm this epidemic stage of O. erosus with high abundances in Dalmatia in 2018 and at least 5 generations per year, which alter the population level of this pest. Finally, with high dispersal abilities of O. erosus through active flight and easy transportation with infested material (logs and branches with bark), O. erosus has the potential to become an important forest pest in Croatia. Thus, extensive studies on its biology, ecology, natural enemies and interaction with ophiostomatoid fungal species are needed in order to predict further spread and suggest viable and effective management measures.",yes,field,damage,,,SEEFOR-SOUTH-EAST EUROPEAN FORESTRY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1847-6481,1849-0891,2019,10.15177/seefor.19-05,WOS:000472600600003

Insect phenology is driven by local climate variables, most notably temperature. Increased warming has been linked to advancements in critical phenophases such as the spring flight of reproductive adults in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.A. 2. Local climate is governed by the fluctuations of large-scale climate oscillations. In the northern hemisphere, both the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) control the local autumn and winter severity. Low NAO and AO indices are associated with colder autumns and winters, which can delay spring phenology. 3. In this study, 36 years of data from experimental fruit orchards in Biglerville, Pennsylvania, were used to run partial least-squares regressions in order to determine the climate variables related to the spring phenology of five tortricid pest species. 4. The phenology of the tortricid pests did not advance, even though there was evidence of warming at the research site. 5. Spring temperatures were found to be the most significant climate variables in determining the timing of the spring flights. However, autumn-winter temperatures were also important. 6. For the NAO and the AO, it was found that these oscillations affected the tortricid moths by influencing autumn-winter conditions. The oscillations of the NAO and AO can obscure long-term changes in phenology. 7. These findings suggest that the inclusion of large-scale climate oscillations can provide important insights into how climate conditions can influence insect phenology, and presents an opportunity for improving the ability to forecast spring emergence.",no,,,,,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0307-6946,1365-2311,2019,10.1111/een.12712,WOS:000467427900008

Because species interactions are highly dependent on the environment, the climate changes foreseen for the coming years are expected to have significant impacts on the evolution of mutualistic interactions. Among mutualisms, the aphid-ant interaction is well documented, partly explained by the pest status of aphids. This literature review focuses on the impact of climate change (particularly atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and temperature) on aphid biology and the potential consequences with respect to their mutualistic interactions with ants. We provide an overview of the published reports concerned with the effects of temperature and carbon dioxide on aphids, for which a positive, a negative or no effect has been highlighted. We then discuss how climatic changes can alter four major components of aphid biology that are shaping their interaction with ants: (i) aphid population growth; (ii) aphid behaviour and mobility; (iii) honeydew production and composition; and (iv) semiochemistry.

The BSB population dynamics was monitored for 17 weeks from tasseling to preharvest of corn plants (i.e., late May to mid-September) using pheromone traps in three corn fields from 2005 to 2009. The trap data showed two peaks in early June and mid-August, respectively. The relationship between trap catch and pregrowing season weather data was examined using correlation and stepwise multiple factor regression analyses. Weather indices used for the analyses were accumulated growing degree day (AGDD), number of days with minimum temperature below 0 degrees C (Subz), accumulated daily maximum (AMaxT) and minimum temperatures (AMinT) and rainfall (ARain). The weather indices were calculated with lower (10 degrees C) and upper (35 degrees C) as biological thresholds. The parameters used in regression analysis were seasonal abundance (or overall mean of BSB adult catch) (BSBm), number of BSB adults caught at a peak (PeakBSB), and peak week (Peakwk). The BSBm was negatively related to high temperature (AmaxT or AGDD) consistently, whereas 1stPeakBSB was positively correlated to both ARain and Subz, irrespective of weather data durations (the first 4, 4.5, and 5 months).

It is one of the most important pests of walnuts in areas gathering 30% of the world production. Knowledge of life-history regulation is important for the design of management strategies. Research on dormancy has been performed on invasive populations, and not on populations at the southern extreme of its native range. Here, we examined the effect of winter length on fly and parasitoid emergence, survival, and duration of dormancy. Percent emergence was higher for chill periods at 5 degrees C ranging from 8 to 20 wk. No or insufficient chill resulted in low emergence and a significant proportion of individuals in prolonged dormancy (>1 yr). Duration of dormancy was longer for pupae at constant temperatures and a 4-wk chill period than longer winter durations. Dormancy was longer for Mexican than that reported for U.S. populations, suggesting the existence of a latitudinal cline where populations at southern latitudes have evolved slower metabolic rates.

J,"Amarasekare, P",Effects of Climate Warming on Consumer-Resource Interactions: A Latitudinal Perspective,"There is increasing evidence that climate warming is impacting biodiversity by disrupting species interactions. Trophic (consumer-resource) interactions, which comprise the fundamental units (modules) of food webs, are of particular importance because they have an intrinsic tendency to fluctuate in abundance, thus running to risk of stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances. Here I present a mathematical framework for predicting warming effects on consumer-resource interactions. This work differs from previous theory in two ways. First, it uses delay differential equations to realistically depict the developmental delays inherent in ectotherm life cycles, and incorporates mechanistic descriptions of phenotypic trait responses, derived from first principles of thermodynamics, into the dynamical delay model. Second, it tests the latest IPCC predictions on warmer-than-average winters and hotter-than-average summers. I investigate warming effects on three major axes: latitude (tropical vs. temperate), life stage attacked (juvenile vs. adult), and nature of consumer-resource dynamics in the absence of temperature variation (stable vs. complex). I report three findings. First, consumer-resource interactions in the tropics are more at risk of species losses due to warming while those in the temperate zone are more at risk of extreme fluctuations in species' abundances. Second, effects of warming are more detrimental when the consumer attacks the adult stage of the resource and when consumer-resource interactions exhibit complex dynamics. Third, hotter-than-average summers are more detrimental to consumer-resource interactions than warmer-than-average winters.

In this study, effects of carbon dioxide (CO2; elevated versus ambient), temperature (T; high versus low), and their interactions on leaf nitrogen content (N%) and C:N ratio of transgenic Bt rice and its non-Bt isoline grown under low- and high-N fertilizer were systematically analyzed together with the resulting insect population dynamics of a non-target planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) in open-top-chamber experiments. The results indicated that under low-N treatment, elevated CO2 at low T (i.e., eCO(2)) (compared to ambient CO2 at low T, i.e., CK) significantly decreased N% and Bt-toxin content and significantly increased C:N ratio in leaf sheath and leaf of Bt rice, especially during the tillering stage, whereas inverse effects of high T were shown on the plant chemistry of Bt rice, especially during heading stage. The combination of elevated CO2 and high T (i.e., Combined) (in contrast to CK) significantly increased N% and decreased C:N ratio in leaf sheath of Bt rice during the heading stage under low-N fertilizer, while significantly decreased N% and increased C:N ratio in leaf of Bt rice during the tillering stage, regardless of fertilizer-N level, and significantly increased Bt-toxin content in leaf sheath and leaf during the tillering stage under both low- and high-N. Moreover, no discernable relationships between Bt-toxin content and N% or leaf C:N ratio were observed at any CO2 or N levels evaluated. Furthermore, transgenic treatment, temperature and fertilizer-N level interactions, and CO2 and fertilizer-N level interactions all significantly affected the population dynamics of N. lugens. Specifically, high-N significantly enhanced the population dynamics of N. lugens fed on non-Bt rice grown under eTemp and Bt cultivar significantly reduced the population dynamics of N. lugens under eCO(2) regardless of N fertilizer levels.

Number and sex of flowers are dependent on climatic conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the impacts of climate (temperatures and rainfalls) on the lychee tree development. Materials and methods - Plant physiology and phenology were studied in the field during different seasons in four lychee production sites in Madagascar, considering the following stages: flowering, fruit formation, fruit development and ripening. The used phenological codes were based on the extended BBCH-scale and described the growth stages of the lychee plant using a three-digit numerical system. The analysis of auxin (indole-3-acetic acid - IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) contents in different plant parts by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), coupled to a diode array detector (DAD), was performed to evaluate potential different physiological dynamics in leaves from branches with or without flowers. Results and discussion - The climatic stresses showed tree growth difficulties, which were explained by a reversal of the production phases (stages 5 to 9) toward the resumption of the growth phases (stages 0 to 3). Changes of auxin and abscisic acid contents indicated a sensitivity of the plants to climate variability: the leaves contained about 10 mg ABA 100 g(-1) dry weight, what is rather low compared to the concentrations of IAA. Based on the BBCH model, the phenological pattern of lychee followed a more marked evolution by phase reversal at a critical point of time, when the stop code leads to growth anomalies. This evolution is considered an anomaly and no longer represents the normal rhythm of the lychee tree development according to BBCH-scale. Conclusion - Unfavourable dimatic conditions such as climatic disturbance may be responsible for the tree hormonal imbalance with potential detrimental effects on lychee cultivation in Madagascar: an accurate understanding of these stages is very important for the correct timing of general orchard management, particularly for disease and pest management, as well as irrigation, fruit retention, flower thinning, flush control, fertilizer effectiveness, and application of plant growth regulators (PGRs).",no,,,,,FRUITS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0248-1294,1625-967X,2019,10.17660/th2019/74.3.1,WOS:000470275600001

Third-instar scales could survive -15 degrees C in dry conditions but froze and were killed when wet and temperatures were cooled to -10 degrees C.

The flight performance of T. leucotreta in the laboratory was affected by cold treatment (relative to a 25 degrees C control group), test temperature and their interaction. Field recapture of released moths was significantly affected by the interaction between cold treatment and environmental conditions. Field recapture counts depended on the ambient temperature upon release. For example, under warmer conditions (>17 degrees C), the recapture count of cold-treated moths was lower than that of the untreated control group, whereas the recapture count of cold-treated moths at cooler temperatures was significantly higher. Our results suggest a temperature-dependent interaction between acute cold exposure and flight performance in adult T. leucotreta, which may be used to enhance the efficacy of the sterile insect technique under cooler environmental conditions.",no,,,,,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1461-9555,1461-9563,2019,10.1111/afe.12326,WOS:000463207800012

Fuss), and celery (Apium graveolens L.). Although native to North America, it is a serious pest across the Eastern United States and Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada. Females deposit eggs in the petiole of cultivated hosts, and upon hatching, larvae tunnel down through the petiole and into plant roots causing wilting, yellowing, and plant death. Scouting procedures focus mainly on adult activity and require detection of small egg scars on the foliage and crown of the root, or reliance on traps that are only effective at the beginning of the season before the crop emerges. Several avenues of cultural, biological, and chemical control have been explored for this pest, but with limited success. Furthermore, investigation of these management strategies have primarily focused on carrot systems, neglecting other cultivated Apiaceae. Here we present a review of carrot weevil research and highlight key knowledge gaps in the carrot weevil system, which impede our understanding of this insect's biology and behavioral ecology. Future research addressing these key knowledge gaps will expand our understanding of this pest and contribute to the development and implementation of more effective management strategies.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,2155-7470,2019,10.1093/jipm/pmz007,WOS:000467930900001

The current studies seek to determine factors influencing R. iceryoides population outbreaks, parasitoid - host and predator-prey relationships as well as predict optimal management strategies through weather modelling over a period of 28 months from 2008 to 2010 in Tanzania. The highest incidence of R. iceryoides was recorded during the dry season coinciding with the major mango fruiting season. The relationship between R. iceryoides and the parasitoid was positive but not significant, which implies the influence on outbreaks was negligible probably due to low percent parasitism (<12%). However, the predator abundance was directly and significantly related to that of R. iceryoides. Average temperature, average relative humidity, rainfall, and R. iceryoides abundance were autocorrelated to each other. Cross-correlation coef?cients vary significantly from -0.286 to 0.589 for the pair-variable between R. iceryoides, temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, parasitism and predators. Our findings showed that temperature was the key climatic variable that significantly influenced R. iceryoides outbreaks while rainfall was significantly negatively associated with the pest. Time series analyses show R. iceryoides population increased 4 months after an increase in average temperature in all the sites, 11 months after rainfall and 11 months after relative humidity in Kibaha and Dar es Salaam, respectively. Our findings revealed that R. iceryoides is an excellent target for classical biological control.

Si has multiple functional roles, particularly for alleviating abiotic and biotic stresses (e.g., defence against herbivores). Recent evidence suggests that environmental change, including temperature changes, can diminish Si accumulation which could affect functions such as herbivore defence. Using a field warming experiment, we grew a pasture grass (Phalaris aquatica) that was either supplemented or untreated with Si (+Si and -Si, respectively) under ambient and elevated (+2.8 degrees C above ambient) air temperatures. We quantified soil water, plant growth rates, Si accumulation, leaf biomechanical properties and in situ relative growth rates of a herbivorous global insect pest (Helicoverpa armigera). Si supplementation promoted shoot and root biomass by c. 48% and 61%, respectively under ambient temperatures, but these gains were not apparent under warmed conditions. Warmer temperatures reduced Si uptake by -Si plants by c. 17%, potentially due to the lower levels of soil water content in warmed plots. Si supplementation, however, increased Si accumulation in leaves by c. 24% in warmed plots restoring Si levels to those seen under ambient temperatures. Si supplementation enhanced biomechanical properties in the leaves, but this was only statistically significant under ambient temperatures; leaves of +Si plants required 42% more force to fracture and were 30% tougher at the midrib than leaves of -Si plants. The relative growth rates of H. armigera declined by 56% when feeding on +Si plants under ambient temperatures, and while Si supplementation caused a trend towards declining herbivore growth rates under warmer conditions, this was not statistically significant. We conclude that climate warming may mitigate the beneficial effects of Si on Phalaris aquatica in the short term, potentially by reducing Si uptake. While Si uptake can be restored with Si supplementation, Si-enhanced biomechanical defences against a global pest may not be fully restored under warmer temperatures.",yes,experimental,laboratory,growth,,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0269-8463,1365-2435,2019,10.1111/1365-2435.13295,WOS:000466375600005

Management practices for D. suzukii currently rely heavily on calendar-based applications of broad-spectrum insecticides, but decision-based applications are theoretically possible with refined population modeling and monitoring. Temperature conditions are strongly deterministic of insect growth rates, fecundity, fertility, and resulting population densities. Therefore, information about the effects of temperature can be incorporated into population modeling to accurately predict D. suzukii population densities in the field which is crucial to maximize pesticide application efficiency and improve sustainability. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic heat stress during all of juvenile development on egg-to-adult viability and fertility. We also investigated egg-to-adult viability under heat stress after heat shock of the maternal parent. We found that heat stress during development results in lower egg-to-adult viability, and reduced lifespan and fertility for surviving adults. However, heat-shock treatment of females prior to egg laying increased the egg-to-adult viability of their eggs under heat stress. Female flies that developed at 30 degrees C had smaller ovaries than the untreated group and male flies had less sperm in their testes, and no sperm in their seminal vesicles. We conclude that heat stress during development is likely to have negative effect on D. suzukii population dynamics in the field.

J,"Cheng, X; Hoffmann, AA; Maino, JL; Umina, PA","Summer diapause intensity influenced by parental and offspring environmental conditions in the pest mite, Halotydeus destructor","The regulation of active and dormant stages of arthropods is critical for surviving unfavourable seasonal conditions, and for many species depends on the diapause intensity (DI). There is substantial information on diapause strategies of arthropods under winter conditions; however, most cases of summer diapause are poorly understood despite its importance in most geographic regions of the world. Here we show how complex interactions with the environment drive DI involving multiple summer diapause forms of the mite Halotydeus destructor. This invasive pest in Australia is only active in cooler months but enters diapause at the egg stage which can survive hot and dry summer conditions. Recent research points to two forms of diapause egg, a typical form with a thick chorion and a cryptic form without this chorion which is morphologically similar to non-diapause eggs. Compared with typical diapause eggs which are produced in late spring, cryptic diapause eggs could be produced together with non-diapause eggs earlier in the season with relatively cooler temperatures and shorter daylength, reflecting an advanced bet-hedging strategy. Fitness trade-offs in this strategy are investigated in this study as variability of DI of the typical and cryptic diapause forms under different environmental factors for incubating diapause eggs (temperature) and rearing parental mites (different daylength, temperature and soil moisture). With the exception of daylength, all factors impacted hatchability of diapause eggs. Higher mortality of cryptic diapause eggs indicated relatively shallower DI than typical diapause eggs, likely reflecting a fitness penalty of this bet-hedging strategy under some conditions. Hatchability of cryptic diapause eggs revealed thermal and moisture stresses have opposite and complementary effects between parental and filial generations. Although DI of filial eggs decreased in hot and dry summer conditions, parental mites reared in hotter and drier conditions increased the DI of offspring. A bet-hedging strategy involving cryptic diapause might be replaced by typical diapause under consistently stressful conditions because of higher survival, regardless of additional production costs that might be required. These findings highlight a complex set of plastic responses to summer conditions in H. destructor that undoubtedly contribute to the success of this invasive pest under a range of environments.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-1910,1879-1611,2019,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.02.011,WOS:000466618800012

In this study, the occurrence of aphids in a seed potato field in Pyeongchang, Korea, was monitored daily using a yellow water pan trap from 1977 to 2017. During these 40 years, the annual migration fluctuations of the aphids were analyzed, with particular focus on four species known to vector potato viruses, Aphis gossypii, Aulacorthum solani, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, and Myzus persicae. It was found that, as time goes by, the start point of spring migration in these aphid species was getting earlier while the peak in autumn migration gradually moved to the winter season. Moreover, the annual total number of collected aphids increased by 3.74 times during the 40 years. Together with a mean annual temperature increase of 1.03 degrees C in Pyeongchang over the past four decades, there is a potential threat of expansion in the distribution of aphid species.

We sourced egg masses from the Appalachian Mountains (AM), where the gypsy moth range is expanding, from the Coastal Plain (CP), where range retraction is occurring, and from a long-established population in New York (NY) and conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment to compare development and fitness components among these populations at two sites along the southern invasion front.

The AM and NY populations did experience reductions in egg viability under a southern winter at the CP site compared to control wintering conditions, while the CP egg masses had equivalent survival.

The model satisfactorily predicts the stage-specific pest population dynamics, including egg laying and hatching, the occurrence of larvae and pupae stages and the emergence of adults.

Twelve transects were selected, covering an overall elevational gradient of 2100 m. SWD abundance was monitored every 2 weeks during the growing season (from June to November 2015) when cultivated and wild hosts are potentially susceptible (i.e. fruits are ripe). 3. Spotted wing drosophila were widely distributed along all the tested elevations, revealing synchrony in population dynamics across ranges in elevation and geographic distance. Synchronised populations were observed at distances of up to 100 km at sites with similar temperatures. The high dispersal potential of the pest together with the seasonal variation in temperature are likely to be the dominant mechanisms causing the observed spatial synchrony. A factor that seemed to reduce synchrony is the large concentration of host plants (i.e. crop) in lowland agricultural landscapes. 4.

J,"Long, LC; D'Amico, V; Frank, SD",Urban forest fragments buffer trees from warming and pests,"Trees are important components of urban landscapes because of the ecosystem services they provide. However, the effects of urbanization, particularly high temperatures, can benefit chronic insect pests and threaten ecosystem services offered by urban trees. Urban forest fragments are an often-overlooked component of the greater urban forest which may help to mitigate the damaging effects of urbanization. Melanaspis tenebricosa (gloomy scale) is a common pest of Acer rubrum (red maple) that becomes more abundant because of the urban heat island effect. We conducted observational and manipulative field experiments to test the hypothesis that trees in urban forest fragments would be cooler than those in surrounding ornamental landscapes and would thus have fewer M. tenebricosa, particularly in a hot mid-latitude city. Trees in forest fragments were 1.3 degrees cooler and had three orders of magnitude fewer M. tenebricosa than trees in ornamental landscapes in Raleigh, NC USA. However, there was no difference in M. tenebricosa density between forest and landscape trees in Newark, DE and Philadelphia, PA USA which are 3.95 degrees of latitude higher, and nearer to the northern range extent. Trees in landscapes and forest fragments did not differ in predawn water potential, a measure of water stress, but likely differed in soil composition and moisture. We used potted trees to control for these differences and found that M. tenebricosa density still increased three times more in landscapes than forests suggesting temperature and not tree stress is the dominant factor. Taken together our results indicate two things. First, that trees growing in urban forest fragments are buffered from a chronic urban tree pest due to lower temperatures. Second, that temperature-driven differences in M. tenebricosa density which we saw in Raleigh could predict future density of the pest in higher latitude cities as the climate warms.

J,"Kistner-Thomas, EJ",The Potential Global Distribution and Voltinism of the Japanese Beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) Under Current and Future Climates,"Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica (Newman), is a severe invasive insect pest of turf, landscapes, and horticultural crops. It has successfully colonized much of the United States and has recently established in mainland Europe. The distribution and voltinism of P. japonica will undoubtedly change as a consequence of climate change, posing additional challenges to the management of this species. To assess these challenges, a process-oriented bioclimatic niche model for P. japonica was developed to examine its potential global distribution under current (1981-2010) and projected climatic conditions (2040-2059) using one emission scenario (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 8.5) and two global climate models, ACCESS1-0 and CNRM-CM5. Under current climatic conditions, the bioclimatic niche model agreed well with all credible distribution data. Model projections indicate a strong possibility of further range expansion throughout mainland Europe under both current and future climates. In North America, projected increases in temperature would enable northward range expansion across Canada while simultaneously shifting southern range limits in the United States. In Europe, the suitable range for P. japonica would increase by 23% by midcentury, especially across portions of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Scandinavia. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, cumulative growing degree-days increased, thereby reducing the probability of biannual life cycles in northern latitudes where they can occur, including Hokkaido, Japan, northeastern portions of the United States, and southern Ontario, Canada.

In addition, economic growth and dietary shifts towards animal source foods have put high pressure and demand on agricultural production. The high ecological footprint of meat and dairy production, as well as high feed costs, prevent the livestock sector from meeting the increasing demand in a sustainable manner. Insects such as the black soldier fly (BSF) have been identified as potential alternatives to the conventionally used protein sources in livestock feed due to their rich nutrient content and the fact that they can be reared on organic side streams. Substrates derived from organic byproducts are suitable for industrial large-scale production of insect meal. Although efficient in waste management and in feed production, BSF larvae are very sensitive to the external environment such as temperature and rearing medium. Therefore, we studied the effect of temperature and substrate type, i.e., brewers' spent grain (SG) and cow dung (CD), on the development and survival of BSF larvae. Both organic substrates were readily available in Nairobi, Kenya, the location of the experiments. In our experiment, 100 3-5-day-old BSF larvae were placed into containers that contained either SG or CD and further treated at temperatures of 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C. The duration of larval development was recorded, and the prepupae were removed, weighed, and placed individually in separate, labeled, 35-mL plastic cups filled with moist sawdust. After emergence, 10 2-day-old adults (5 males and 5 females) from every replica per substrate were transferred into a cage (40 x 40 x 40 cm) and allowed to mate for 24 h at their respective temperatures. The laid egg batches were collected and counted, and the adult flies' longevity was recorded. The data were subjected to a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the general linear model procedure. BSF larvae reared on SG developed faster than those reared on CD; the former also favored higher temperatures for their larval development and emergence into adults. The optimum range was 25-30 degrees C. With increasing temperatures, the longevity of adult BSF decreased, while the fecundity of females increased. Thus, it is possible to take advantage of the readily available SG waste streams in the urban environments of Kenya to produce BSF larvae-derived livestock feed within a short duration of time and at relatively high temperatures.",yes,experimental,laboratory,fecundity,,ANIMALS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2076-2615,NA,2019,10.3390/ani9030079,WOS:000464320800001

The most economically damaging species, the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), cannot overwinter in temperate East Asia, and infestations there are initiated by several waves of windborne spring or summer migrants originating from tropical areas in Indochina. The interaction of these waves of migrants and synoptic weather patterns, driven by the semi-permanent western Pacific subtropical high-pressure (WPSH) system, is of critical importance in forecasting the timing and intensity of immigration events and determining the seriousness of subsequent planthopper build-up in the rice crop. We analysed a 26-year data set from a standardised light trap network in Southern China, showing that planthopper aerial transport and concentration processes are associated with the characteristics (strength and position) of the WPSH in the year concerned. Then, using N. lugens abundance in source areas and indices of WPSH intensity or related sea surface temperature anomalies, we developed a model to predict planthopper numbers immigrating into the key rice-growing area of the Lower Yangtze Valley. We also demonstrate that these WPSH-related climatic indices combined with early-season planthopper catches can be used to forecast, several months in advance, the severity of that season'sN. lugens infestations (the correlation between model predictions and outcomes was 0.59), thus allowing time for effective control measures to be implemented.",yes,field,abundance,,,JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1612-4758,1612-4766,2019,10.1007/s10340-018-1022-9,WOS:000463146700005

The knowledge of its biological traits is fundamental to establish sustainable pest management strategies. One of the main factors determining population dynamics of arthropods is temperature. Therefore, modelling the response of the development of pests to this factor contributes to anticipate risk situations and to establish possible new areas of colonization. A mortality model and thirty-two developmental models were used to describe the relationship between the immature survival and developmental rate of D. suzukii versus temperature. The survival and developmental times of the immature stages were determined across a broad range of temperatures (10-31 degrees C). Then, the models were fitted and the predictions of the developmental models compared with the developmental times obtained under three regimes of fluctuating temperatures (4-16, 13-25 and 21-32 degrees C). Developmental models were applied to the complete range of temperatures studied at each regime, or they were truncated for the lower and upper regimes at the temperatures that produced 100% immature mortality estimated with the mortality model (8.7-30.9 degrees C). Better predictions were obtained with the non-truncated models, indicating that some development occurred under short exposures to temperatures beyond those producing 100% mortality during immature development.

The pre-adult development of H. halys was noticeably faster under L:D 12:12 compared with L:D 15:9. The sum of effective temperatures required for the pre-adult development was ca. 530 and 590 degree days under these two conditions, respectively, whereas the lower developmental thresholds were similar (ca. 13.3 degrees C). Adults of H. halys demonstrated a typical long-day-type photoperiodic response of facultative winter adult diapause induction: Short days (photophases of 12-15h) induced diapause in all adults, whereas long days (with photophases longer than 15h) promoted reproduction. The photoperiodic responses of diapause induction of females and males were very similar. At 24 degrees C, the threshold of the response was between 15 and 16h. At 20 degrees C, even under the very long-day conditions (L:D 18:6) about 50% of adults entered diapause. Field records suggest that H. halys likely produces two generations per year in Sochi.

The winter pine processionary moths (Thaumetopoea pityocampa and Th. wilkinsoni) are important pests of pines and cedars in the Mediterranean region. They are typically univoltine, with larvae feeding across the winter, pupating in spring in the soil and emerging as adults in summer. Pupae may, however, enter a prolonged diapause with adults emerging one or more years later. We tested the effect of variation in winter temperature on the incidence of prolonged diapause, using a total of 64 individual datasets related to insect cohorts over the period 1964-2015 for 36 sites in seven countries, covering most of the geographic range of both species. We found high variation in prolonged diapause incidence over their ranges. At both lower and upper ends of the thermal range in winter, prolonged diapause tended to be higher than at intermediate temperatures. Prolonged diapause may represent a risk-spreading strategy to mitigate climate uncertainty, although it may increase individual mortality because of a longer exposure to mortality factors such as predation, parasitism, diseases or energy depletion. Climate change, and in particular the increase of winter temperature, may reduce the incidence of prolonged diapause in colder regions whereas it may increase it in warmer ones, with consequences for population dynamics.",no,,,,,PEERJ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2167-8359,NA,2019,10.7717/peerj.6530,WOS:000460030200013

Forest decline due to disease and/or pests is a complex phenomenon, and a knowledge of the spatial patterns of tree mortality is important for providing an understanding of forest susceptibility and pest dynamics. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the spatial structure of pine mortality and that of different climatic, edaphic and landscape variables in an area of Portugal where B. xylophilus is known to have spread during the last decade. Methods: Pine mortality was assessed in the field, in a large, complex area of Central-North Portugal. An ArcGis database with a range of environmental variables was created for the study area. Spatial autocorrelation of the different variables was investigated by means of Moran's I and Mantel r analysis. The relationship between pine decline and the different variables was analyzed using bivariate Moran's I. Results: Environmental descriptors exhibit a clear spatial pattern, influenced by an undulating landscape. Pine mortality is spatially aggregated; warm, dry locations with higher evapotranspiration present high values, and in areas of extensive pine occupancy in a diverse landscape mortality decreases. Conclusions: Forest mortality attributed to infestation by a non-native forest pathogen cannot be dissociated from the effects of climate and landscape diversity associated with pine forests.

In cotton [Gossypium spp. (Malvales: Malvaceae)], new irrigation practices such as deficit irrigation may impact populations of pest and beneficial arthropods by temporarily altering temperature profiles within the plant canopy. Most information regarding the temperature-dependent development and survival of an important cotton pest, the western tarnished plant bug (Lygus hesperus Knight), is derived from constant temperature studies. We examined the development and survival of L. hesperus nymphs under constant (+/- 0.2 degrees C) and variable (+/- 8 degrees C) temperature regimes at daily mean temperatures of 15, 22, and 29 degrees C. Under the low temperature (15 degrees C), stadium lengths and duration of the nymphal stage were shorter when temperatures were variable compared with a constant temperature. No differences in development times were observed between regimes at the medium temperature (22 degrees C). Except for the first stadium, development times under the high variable temperature regime were longer compared with the high constant regime (29 degrees C). Nymph survival was unaffected by temperature regime except at the lowest temperature, where daily thermal fluctuations substantially improved survival compared with the constant conditions. These results suggest that temporarily increased crop canopy temperatures caused by altered irrigation schemes are unlikely to substantially reduce the growth of L. hesperus populations.

One potential way to control this pest is the sterile insect technique (SIT) which demands a large stock of reproductive females to produce millions of sterile males to be released on demand. Unfortunately, Drosophila stocks age quickly, show declining fecundity when maintained at warm temperatures and conversely, they die from chill injury if they are maintained at constant low temperature. Here we investigate the potential of fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) as a storage method that harness the benefits of both warm and cold storage. Using a FTR with a daily warm period (1 h 20 at 25 degrees C) and cold period (20 h at 3 degrees C), interspaced by gradual heating and cooling, we compared longevity, fecundity and physiological condition between FTR females and females exposed to constant 25 degrees C and 3 degrees C. As hypothesised, FTR flies experienced much slower senescence (> 3-fold increase in lifespan) and they preserved fecundity to a much higher age than flies from constant 25 degrees C. Flies maintained at constant 3 degrees C quickly died from chill injuries caused by a gradual loss of ion and water balance. In contrast, FTR flies were able to maintain ion and water balance (similar to 25 degrees C flies) as they were allowed to recover homeostasis during the short warm periods. Together these results demonstrate that FTR represents a useful protocol for storage of Drosophila stocks, and more broadly, this shows that the benefits of FTR are tightly linked with the insect ability to recover physiological homeostasis during the short warm periods.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-1910,1879-1611,2019,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.01.001,WOS:000463121900005

J,"Stazione, L; Norry, FM; Sambucetti, P",Heat-hardening effects on mating success at high temperature in Drosophila melanogaster,"Reproduction is strongly influenced by environmental temperature in insects. At high temperature, mating success could be influenced not only by basal (non-inducible) thermotolerance but also by inducible plastic responses. Here, mating success at high temperature was tested in flies carrying contrasting genotypes of heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. The possible heat-hardening effect was tested. Mating success did not differ between heat-resistant and heat-sensitive genotypes when tested both at high (33 degrees C) and benign (25 degrees C) temperature, independently of the heat-hardening status. Importantly, heat-hardening pre-treatment increased in a 70% the number of matings at 33 degrees C in a mass-mating experiment. Further, mating latency at 33 degrees C was shorter with heat hardening than without it in single-pair assays Heat-hardening had previously been showed to improve short-term thermotolerance in many organisms including Drosophila, and the present results show that heat hardening also improve mating success at elevated temperature. Previous exposures to a mild heat stress improve short-term mating success as a plastic response of ecological relevance. Such heat-hardening effects on mating success should be relevant for predicting potential evolutionary responses to any possible current scenery of global warming, as well as in sterile insect release programs for pest control in elevated temperature environments.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0306-4565,NA,2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.001,WOS:000460827600022

The mealybug Dysmicoccus brevipes (Cockerell) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is one of the most common species in Brazilian vineyards. Here, development and survival of D. brevipes on leaves of table grapes (Vitis vinifera cv. Italia) were studied at five constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 28, and 30 +/- 1 degrees C) under laboratory conditions. We investigated the developmental time and nymphal survival, temperature thresholds, and the degree-day requirements for each life stage of D. brevipes. The developmental time for the nymphal stage ranged from 32 to 130days with decreasing the temperature, with the temperatures of 28 and 30 degrees C providing the shorter developmental time. Survival of the entire nymphal stage was affected by the temperature, ranging from 81% at 20 degrees C to 1% at 15 degrees C. The predicted upper lethal temperature was 34.5 degrees C, while the optimal temperature was 28.6 degrees C. The minimum threshold for total development of D. brevipes occurred at 8.2 degrees C. Dysmicoccus brevipes required 678.4 degree-days to complete development from first-instar nymph to adult. The temperature of 30 degrees C was the most suitable for the development of D. brevipes.

Knowledge regarding these factors throughout the year represents a key concern for IPM programmes. Seasonal population fluctuations of tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta, led to an investigation of its natural mortality factors during the rainy season when the population level is low and during the dry season when population peaks occur. The aim of this study was to verify the seasonal variation in T. absoluta mortality factors in tomato crops. Immature stages of T. absoluta were obtained from laboratory-rearing in the laboratory. These were taken to the field and monitored over two years. The mortality causes for each stage of insect development from egg to adult were assessed daily. Multiple biotic and abiotic mortality factors affected the immature T. absoluta stages such as rainfall, physiological disturbances, diseases, parasitoids and predators. The key T. absoluta mortality factor during summer-spring was predation. In addition, larvae predation correlated positively with temperature, wind velocity, photoperiod and rainfall. Nevertheless, during winter-fall, the key mortality factor was parasitism. Therefore, the critical stage for mortality was 3rd- and 4th-instar larvae, being more vulnerable to natural control factors.

This study evaluated the influence of constant (23.0 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures (average of 23.0 degrees C) on the population development of these two species. The results showed that both of these pests showed faster development and higher fecundity at a constant temperature than at fluctuating temperatures when fed on Rosa rugosa flowers, and F. occidentalis showed faster development and higher fecundity than T. hawaiiensis under both conditions. Under the constant and fluctuating temperatures, the development times from egg to adult were 9.57 and 10.62 day for F. occidentalis and 10.71 and 11.82 day for T. hawaiiensis, respectively. The total numbers of first instar nymph produced were 103.08 and 86.32 by F. occidentalis, 86.96 and 73.32 by T. hawaiiensis, under the constant and fluctuating temperatures, respectively, and a higher intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) (0.173 and 0.160) and R-0 (46.31 and 36.86) were obtained in F. occidentalis compared with T. hawaiiensis (r(m) for 0.154 and 0.141 and R-0 for 34.46 and 27.81, respectively). Our results indicate that the constant temperature had a positive effect on the population development of both F. occidentalis and T. hawaiiensis. Furthermore, F. occidentalis showed a stronger adaptability over T. hawaiiensis at both constant and fluctuating temperatures, according to its faster development and higher fecundity.

Understanding how cultivated plants, their associated community members (including pest insects, natural enemies, soil microbes), and their interactions respond to warming to influence crop yields is critical to current and future food security. We conducted a two-year field study on the effects of elevated temperature on winter wheat growth and grain quality, insect pests, natural enemies, ground arthropods, weeds, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). RESULTSElevated temperature shortened the period of wheat growth, decreased grain yield, and reduced grain quality by increasing fiber and decreasing wet gluten, protein, total soluble sugars, and starch. Elevated temperature also increased aphid abundance while decreasing AMF colonization rates. Structural equation modeling indicated that the direct negative effect of warming on wheat yield was augmented by indirect negative effects via increased aphid and weed abundances along with decreased AMF colonization. CONCLUSIONClimate change can potentially affect crop production and quality both directly and indirectly by modifying interactions with aboveground and belowground organisms. Future studies on the effects of climate change on crops should consider the responses of aboveground and belowground biotic community members and their interactions with crop plants.

Mild winters and higher spring temperatures increase E. abietinum population densities, although this positive response to warmer conditions might be over-ridden if E. abietinum is adversely affected by exceptionally high summer temperatures. In laboratory experiments, aphids exposed to temperatures above 25 degrees C became more restless and were more likely to drop from the shoot, and subsequently showed a reduction in mean relative growth rate. In contrast, survival was not reduced significantly unless temperatures exceeded 35 degrees C. Field data from Radnor Forest in Wales indicated that E. abietinum populations in the autumn were inversely correlated with mean and maximum summer temperatures, at temperatures below those that had a negative impact in the laboratory. The greater sensitivity of populations in the field to high summer temperatures may reflect higher temperatures at the needle surface compared with the temperature of the surrounding air, or associated increases in natural enemy activity.

During outbreak years they cause severe defoliation in many forest stands in Europe. In order to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics and elucidate possible influences of weather, stand and site conditions, a generalized additive mixed model was developed. The investigated data base was derived from glue band catch monitoring stands of both species in Central and North Germany. From the glue bands only female moth individuals are counted and a hazard code is calculated. The model can be employed to predict the exceedance of a warning threshold of this hazard code which indicates a potential severe defoliation of oak stands by winter moth and mottled umber in the coming spring. Results: The developed model accounts for specific temporal structured effects for three large ecoregions and random effects at stand level. During variable selection the negative model effect of pest control and the positive model effects of mean daily minimum temperature in adult stage and precipitation in early pupal stage were identified. Conclusion: The developed model can be used for short-term predictions of potential defoliation risk in Central and North Germany. These predictions are sensitive to weather conditions and the population dynamics. However, a future extension of the data base comprising further outbreak years would allow for deeper investigation of the temporal and regional patterns of the cyclic dynamics and their causal influences on abundance of winter moth and mottled umber.",yes,field,abundance,,,FOREST ECOSYSTEMS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2095-6355,2197-5620,2019,10.1186/s40663-019-0162-6,WOS:000457319700001

Potential injury on cherry was then assessed by quantifying changes in the number of salivary sheaths present, weight, percent deformation, and fungal presence on each fruit. Increasing H. halys infestation density decreased fruit weight, while increasing numbers of salivary sheaths. Similarly, increased infestation density decreased number of marketable cherries and overall yield.

In the paper, we investigated the seasonal and perennial dynamics of vegetable crops pests' population of Mamestra brassicae in the agrobiocenoses of white cabbage. The basis of our study was the investigation of the relative quantity of the pest larvae, we demonstrated the damage to plants, as well as the periods of intensive emergence of the imago and the number of generations per year. In future, this will enable the development of effective ecologically sound methods for controlling the number of species of white cabbage pests in the conditions of Kamin-Kashyrskyi district of Volyn region. Kamin-Kashyrskyi area has a flat terrain and is characterized by a warm temperate continental climate with sufficient amount of moisture, the presence of impoverished sod-podzolic soils. The area is mostly plain, with large marsh massifs, which are favorable conditions for the existence of Mamestra brassicae, as this species is moisture-loving. Observation of biocenotic connections in the agrobiocenoses of white cabbage and stationary research on the development of protection, testing and implementation systems was carried out during 2017-2018 at the garden sites of Kamin-Kashirsky district during the entire vegetation period of the plants. White cabbage is damaged throughout the period of vegetation, however, the damage that appear after emergence of seedlings and planting of seedlings into the soil are dangerous due to their consequences. In the second half of summer and in autumn, the larvae of Mamestra brassicae caused significant damage to cabbage plants in the gardens of Novi Chervyshcha. Within this area, Mamestra brassicae develops two generations per year, causing tangible damage to the agrocoenosis of cabbage of different sowing dates. The contamination of cabbage by the larva of the first and second generations approximately accounts to 24%, where 2-3 larvae live on one plant. The massive emergence of the imago occurs in the middle of May the first half of June while the average daily temperature is +20 degrees C to +22 degrees C. The first egg laying was recorded at the end of May, which the female lays in groups, 20-80 units on the underside of the leaves, and the embryonic development lasts 6 to 8 days. Pupae hibernate in the soil, at a depth of 8-12 cm. Significant damage to white cabbage plants was caused by the larvae of the first generation in June and early July, and of the second generation in August and early September. They intensively feed at night and at dawn, and in the daytime there is a decline in mobility and nutritional activity. Second-generation larvae often bite into cabbage heads where they make holes and pollute them with their liquid excrement, which leads to a decrease in crops.

Climate change is a major risk to sub-Saharan Africa and the southern Africa region. Pests are, and will continue to be responsible for crop losses which may amount to more than 40% worldwide. Climate change and weather patterns directly affect the distribution, development and population dynamics of insect pests and it may facilitate the spread of indigenous and exotic species. The aim of the study was to identify and evaluate major pests of vegetables in South Africa and Zimbabwe in relation to climate variability. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to solicit data from respondents. This was done across all nine provinces of South Africa and five agro-ecological zones in Zimbabwe. Key informants and focus groups were used to triangulate the data. Whiteflies and aphids collected from field and greenhouse sampling sites were phenotyped to determine the possible species present. In Zimbabwe, farmers perceived an increase in the abundance of insect pests such as aphids, whiteflies, stem borers, ball worms, red spider mite, termites and diamondback moths and the emergence of new pests. The increase in pest populations was perceived to be caused by short winters, higher temperatures and lengthy dry spells. In South Africa, the major pest outbreaks were aphids, whiteflies, red spider mites and thrips. Moreover, some of these pests are vectors of destructive viral pathogens. Emerging whitefly-transmitted torrado, crini, and begomoviruses were identified in major vegetable growing regions throughout South Africa. From this study, Tomato torrado virus (ToTV) was reported for the first time from continental Africa continent. In addition, several weed species significantly contributed to the epidemiology of vector-borne disease in commercial and smallholder farming communities. Preliminary risk maps for possible pest and disease outbreaks were produced for the two countries.

Here we evaluated the development time, fecundity and longevity of 7: absoluta on three different host plant cultivars grown in Tunisia: tomato (cv. Sankara), potato (cv. Spunta) and eggplant (cv. A336), under controlled laboratory conditions. Results showed a higher capacity of T. absoluta to develop on tomato with a shorter development time (about 31 days) and a higher fecundity (20.47 eggs per female) and longevity (14 days) compared to developing on either potato or eggplant. The development time (egg to adult) of T. absoluta on tomato plant was longer at both lower temperature (21 degrees C), as compared to the higher 28 degrees C, and higher relative humidity (either 52 or 72%), as compared to the lower 32% relative humidity. Fecundity of T. absoluta females on tomato plant was highest at 28 degrees C and 52% relative humidity, as compared to that obtained at 21 degrees C.

AND THE IMPACT OF PEST ON THE HOST PLANT,"Thrips nigropilosus Uzel is a polyphagous species occurring mainly in temperate climates. Its life cycle depends on photoperiodic and temperature conditions. T. nigropilosus feeds on different plant species, but it is considered one of the most serious pests of pyrethrum plants causing serious economic problems. However, several additional agricultural host plants have been affected by T. nigropilosus, including spearmint, cucumber, and lettuce, indicating that this insect can significantly widen its habitats and occurs especially frequently in greenhouses. We report that T. nigropilosus massively attacked Mentha x piperita L. cultivated in greenhouses in central Poland and destroyed the entire mint crops within a short time. The study provided insight into the harmful effect of the thrips and showed that the length of the thrips developmental cycle was reduced with temperature increases from 18 to 26.6 degrees C. The lower threshold temperatures were 13.7, 10.2, 5.0, and 10.1 for eggs, larvae, pupae, and total development, respectively, and the thermal constant for the same developmental stages was 65.9, 90, 132.5, and 284.9-degree days. Both parameters were estimated by linear regression analysis. During our experiment, T. nigropilosus developed by thelytokous parthenogenesis. The morphological and anatomical changes in damaged plants were associated with the fact that the insect began feeding on the lower lamina surface close to the leaf midribs, but no damage to vascular bundles and glandular cells was observed.",no,,,,,ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-HORTORUM CULTUS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1644-0692,2545-1405,2019,10.24326/asphc.2019.3.21,WOS:000478566800020

The main objective of the study was to perform comprehensive ecological research on oak cambio- and xylophagous insects, with the aim to determine their participation and role in the decline of oak stands and to develop more effective methods of forecasting the occurrence and limiting excessive abundance of oak cambio- and xylophagous insects. Field studies were conducted on 26 permanent and temperature observation plots. For detailed qualitative and quantitative entomological analyzes, there were selected weakened, dying and dead oak trees colonized by cambio- and xylophagous insects and their entomophages. Entomological analyzes were carried out over the entire length of trees - within 1 -meter sections. The field experiments were supplemented by laboratory cultures of tree sections with feeding cambio- and xylophagous larvae. On the basis of detailed entomological analyzes of 220 weakened, dying and dead oaks, 40 cambio- and xylophagous insect species were found, including 19 secondary pest insect species, that played an important role in the process of breaking weakened oak trees, as well as fragments of oak stands of various age classes. They were characterized by high values of ecological indices (stability, domination and density of occurrence, the synthetic index Q, Agrell's index, indicator of trunk length colonization and density of feeding sites) and significant size of damage caused as well as leading position in micro -succession chains on weakened trees.It was found that as the age of oak stands increased, there changed the species composition and quantitative structure of communities and micro-environmental-trophic associations of cambio- and xylophagous insects. There was demonstrated the dependence of some cambio- and xylophagous species on the type and condition of breeding material, tree age, height and DBH, as well as tree trunk diameter and thickness of the bark. Among the factors limiting the population size of the most frequently and numerously occurring secondary pest insects, parasitoids from the Ichneumonidae family (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae) and woodpeckers were the most important.

WFT is a pest of vegetables in greenhouses worldwide. It is susceptible to high temperatures in its natural environment and is controlled using heat treatment in China. WFT population growth is suppressed by a brief exposure to a high temperature of 40 degrees C or 45 degrees C in the laboratory. To explore the mechanism by which high temperatures suppress the growth of WFT populations, as well as the effects of multiple heat treatments on WFT, we recorded the duration of development and survival of immature WFT, and the sex ratio (female/male) and fecundity of F-1, F-2, F-3 and F-4 adult females that developed after a single heat shock, and those of F-2 offspring after a double heat shock. We also recorded the longevity and ovarian structure of adult females of the treated generation (P) and their F-1, F-2 and F-3 offspring after a single heat shock. In addition, we determined whether the effects of a heat shock on second instar nymphs and adults differed. The results indicate that exposure of the parental generation to 41 degrees C or 45 degrees C for 2 h significantly prolonged the duration of development, reduced survival of immature WFT and altered the sex ratio (female/male), longevity and fertility of their adult female offspring. The effects of a heat shock of 41 degrees C persisted for two generations, whilst the effect of heat shock of 45 degrees C persisted for three generations. In addition, double heat shocks had more pronounced effects than a single heat shock. Heat shock administered to second instar nymphs resulted in a decrease in the number of ovarioles, whilst a heat shock administered to adults resulted in ovariole deformity. The maternal effects of heat shock in terms of the biological parameters of WFT, structure and number of ovarioles, are critical in determining the suppression of the growth at high temperatures of WFT populations.",no,,,,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,1802-8829,2019,10.14411/eje.2019.023,WOS:000473414400009

The objective of this study is to increase their shelf life without signifi cantly reducing their fi tness. The ladybird Hippodamia variegata is a widespread and voracious aphidophagous predator, with an important role in decreasing the abundance of pest aphids in many parts of the world. We investigated the effect of storage at three temperatures: constant 1 degrees C, constant 6 degrees C, and an alternating thermal regime of 12 degrees C/0 degrees C (the higher temperature for 12 h and the lower one for another 12 h). They were exposed to each of the temperature regimes for either 15, 25, 35, 45 or 60 days. We recorded survival, pre-oviposition period, fecundity and voracity of adult H. variegata following storage. The survival of adult beetles significantly declined with increasing storage duration at all three temperatures. Storage at 6 degrees C up to 35 days and at 12 degrees C/0 degrees C up to 45 days had no significant effects on the fecundity of the lady-birds, but storage for longer signifi cantly decreased fecundity. Beetles stored at 1 degrees C for any of the durations had signifi cantly lower fecundities. Prolonged cold storage caused an increase in the pre-oviposition period at all storage temperatures. Generally, 6 degrees C and 12 degrees C/0 degrees C are the best temperatures for storing the ladybirds as they had the least negative effect on their fitness.

As major alterations are occurring in climate and pest ranges, it is imperative to evaluate their combined contribution to tree mortality in order to propose mitigation measures and limit losses in forest productivity. The objective of this study was to explore the association between declines in tree growth resulting from climatic and biotic (spruce budworm) disturbances, and their interactions on tree mortality of two dominant tree species, Abies balsamea and Picea mariana, of the eastern North-American boreal forest. 2. We disentangle the influences of abiotic and biotic components on growth through a combination of model-data comparison techniques. First, we characterized the variability in tree growth and mortality in the study area using a network of tree-ring width measurements collected from living and dead trees. Subsequently, a bioclimatic simulation model was used to estimate the past annual, nonlinear, responses of stand-level net primary production (NPP) to climate variability (period 1902-2012). From these two data sources, we defined the biotic stress events as the variance in the tree-ring data unexplained by the bioclimatic forest growth simulation. 3. Throughout the 20th century, two periods of adverse climatic conditions preceded spruce budworm outbreaks episodes and induced tree mortality. Climatic stress events were associated with cold springs, warmer than average summers. We found that past stress history in interaction with tree characteristics and species predisposed trees to mortality. In addition, co-occurring events (climatic and biotic) increased the severity of mortality episodes. 4. Synthesis. Our study challenges the belief that spruce budworm outbreak is the primary driver of broad-scale tree mortality in eastern boreal forest. Rather, tree mortality is the result of cumulative events that combine unfavourable conditions for growth, resulting in loss of tree vigour and subsequently, mortality. Co-occurrence of stresses in the future may lead to more severe episodes of mortality, as extreme climatic events become more frequent.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-0477,1365-2745,2019,10.1111/1365-2745.13012,WOS:000459070600037

Early authors pointed to dry summers as the trigger; around 1980, the explanation was improved via modelling of historical data. The number of precipitation days and the July temperature proved to be important, and in experiments, moist soil caused considerable mortality. This information was used in preliminary forecasting with pheromone trap catches as biofix for estimations of occurrence and survival. As more precise information on temperature effects on growth and survival was needed, we performed experiments on growth and mortality effects on egg, all larval instars and pupae. We found clear positive relations between temperatures below 35 degrees C and development rates of eggs, all larval instars and pupae. Mortality was also affected, and low temperature caused pronounced mortality of young larvae. The severe mortality under cold, moist conditions versus high survival under warm, dry conditions may explain both the lack of relation between captures and injuries and the pronounced fluctuations of cutworm attacks in NW Europe reported from 1905 to present.

In this study we assessed maize at six markets in the Northern Region of Ghana, in and around Tamale, during the harvest and storage period of October 2015-June 2016. Across all the markets and sampling periods grain temperature was 32.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C and equilibrium moisture content (EMC) was 9.5 +/- 0.2%. EMC tended to decrease to a low in January and February and then increased again, while mean maize temperature was above 30 degrees C in all months. The primary stored product insects collected from the samples were Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), Sitophilus spp., Rhyzopertha dominica (Fauvel), and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens). Using all the market and sampling month data, there was a significant correlation between EMC and total number of insects recovered, but not between total number of insects and temperature. The average percentage of insect-damaged kernels (IDK) in the maize sampled across all the markets and sampling periods was 2.7 +/- 0.2%, with a range between 0 and 21.4%. Using all the market and sampling month data, levels of insect damage tended to be positively correlated with maize moisture, but not temperature, and levels of insect damage increased with number of stored product insects recovered. The action threshold for aflatoxin in maize in Ghana is 15 ppb, but overall mean aflatoxin level was 19.8 +/- 1.5 ppb and aflatoxin levels ranged from 03 to 132.2 ppb, with 53% of the samples having levels above 15 ppb.

In the first experiment, eggs did not develop through to the adult stage on rough rice hulls, paddy rice dust, and milled rice dust, while eggs developed to the adult stage to some extent on rice flour, milled whole kernels, brown rice, milled broken kernels, and bran. For the diets where development occurred, the lowest percentage was on brown rice, and adults that emerged on brown rice had smaller elytra compared to adults emerging on the other diets. In the second experiment, 1-2-day old neonates were exposed on the diets listed above and held at 22, 27, 32, and 37 degrees C. At all temperatures, development to the pupal and adult stages was slowest on rice flour. At 22 degrees C, development to those stages took about twice as long compared to development at 27 degrees C. As temperature increased developmental times were reduced. Even though neonates developed slowest on rice flour adult emergence rates were not affected. Predictive models were used to estimate potential population development on the diets. At 22 and 27 degrees C, adult size as measured by elytra length was greatest when they developed on bran, while body weight was generally lowest for adults that developed on brown rice. Results show that T. castaneum can utilize rice components and by-products produced during the rice milling process, although not all components or by-products were optimal for development, and emphasis should be placed on cleaning and sanitation to remove food sources to limit infestations.

J,"Zhu, L; Wang, L; Ma, CS",Sporadic short temperature events cannot be neglected in predicting impacts of climate change on small insects,"Climate warming is characterized by increase in extreme heat events (EHEs).

Among these scenarios, low-frequency and short-duration extreme heat events during long mild periods (sporadic short EHEs) and low-frequency and short-duration mild periods during long extreme heat events (sporadic short mild periods) commonly occur in nature. The biological effects of these two types of temperature events have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. To clarify the biological effects of these temperature events on organisms, we selected the English grain aphid, a globally important cereal pest, as our model system. We exposed aphids to simulated 24-h diurnal fluctuating temperatures, inserted these events during the wheat growing season and then investigated development, adult longevity, fecundity, survival, and demographic parameters. We found that sporadic short mild periods during a long EHE could improve their life history traits. Increasing the duration of mild periods from 1 day to 2 days did not significantly change their demographic performance. Sporadic short EHEs during a long mild period did not significantly affect vital rates, while increasing the duration of EHEs from 1 day to 2 days worsened the aphids' performance. We found that short mild episodes in the hot season may benefit small insects to buffer long duration heatwaves. We discussed how sporadic short mild periods during a long EHE supplied aphids a chance to recover from heat stress. Thus, we suggest that sporadic temperature events should be considered in population prediction of small insects under climate change and should be integrated into pest management.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-1910,1879-1611,2019,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.12.003,WOS:000456228600007

Methodology : The data on adult trap catches of S. exigua were recorded daily and weekly means were computed. Log transformed trap catches data were used for correlation with weather parameters of current week, 1-lag, 2-lag and 3-lag weeks. Thereafter, multiple-linear regression analysis was done and a model was developed. The prediction model of S. exigua was validated with the appropriate statistical tools. Results : Peak incidence of S. exigua was recorded during 45th standard meteorological week (SMW) with 15.6 moths per trap per week. Amongst current, 1-lag, 2-lag and 3-lag week weather parameters, the male moth population had significant positive correlation with maximum temperature (T,) and minimum temperature and negative correlation with morning relative humidity (RH,) of 2-lag week. The sunshine hours/day (SSH) of current week had a significant negative association with S. exigua male moth catches, while the soil temperature (ST) of 2-lag week had highest positive correlation with trap catches.

J,"Matzrafi, M",Climate change exacerbates pest damage through reduced pesticide efficacy,"Pesticide efficacy is strongly associated with environmental conditions. Conditional resistance defined as a reduction in pesticide sensitivity under changed environmental conditions has been widely detected under climatic changes such as elevated temperatures and CO2 enrichment. Given the effects of environmental conditions on pesticide sensitivity, many of the putative resistance reports made by farmers may be due to pesticide application followed by non-optimal environmental conditions rather than the evolution of resistance. This type of conditional resistance may be the result of phenotypic plasticity or epigenetic changes in response to environmental changes. Elevated temperatures and CO2 enrichment can directly lead to reduced pesticide efficacy by altering pesticide metabolism and translocation, or indirectly increasing pesticide detoxification in host-plants thus reducing pesticide availability for the target pest. Stress-related signal transduction pathways, as well as physiological changes, can both be associated with accelerated pesticide detoxification under climatic changes. The possibility for parallel mechanisms controlling these responses in different pest species should be considered. It is proposed that the same mechanisms leading to non-target site resistance in pests may also play a role in conditional resistance, suggesting we can predict the pesticides to which pests are likely to be less responsive under changing climatic conditions. Using adjuvants to improve pesticide translocation or reduce pesticide metabolism, alongside with new technologies such as using nanoparticles may result in higher pesticide functionality under the projected climate change. Exploring the physiological, transcriptional and biochemical basis underlying conditional resistance is crucial in maintaining future pest management under changing environmental conditions.

During the period of early spring emergence and movement to the overwintering refuge in the late season, growers need to control C. vitis properly. We developed forecasting models of early spring emergence and late summer overwintering movement of C. vitis in vineyards for control time. Their activation in the early spring was estimated by changes in density between upper bud and the whole bud. The density of C. vitis on buds was estimated using a washing out method. The proportion of C. vitis on the upper bud was increased as accumulated degree-day (DD) was increased. This relationship was well described by a linear regression model. Based on the model, 153 DD with a base temperature of 10.51 degrees C, at which emergence rate of C. vitis deutogynes was 70%, was proposed as the control time for C. vitis. Movement of deutogynes in the late summer was observed. The ratio of C. vitis movement for hibernation was increased as the relative night length was getting longer. This relationship was well described by a two-parameter Weibull function. Proportion of migrant deutogynes was low in August. It increased sharply when relative night length was 0.499 (11.97 h, middle September).

The Hawaiian archipelago is host to over three dozen invasive scolytines, many of which occur on Kaua?i and are pests of agriculture. We analyzed scolytine community dynamics at two coffee estates: a hand-harvested site in a tropical wet forest and a mechanically harvested site in a tropical dry savanna. Our regression analyses show overall scolytine abundance was negatively correlated with rainfall, as were four species: the tropical nut borer (Hypothenemus obscurus), H. brunneus, Cryphalus longipilus, and Xyleborinus andrewesi. These relationships contributed to the compositions of the communities being markedly dissimilar despite having the same species richness.

J,"Cao, JY; Xing, K; Liu, HP; Zhao, F",Effects of developmental acclimation on fitness costs differ between two aphid species,"Most ectotherms are able to increase their tolerance to heat stress via the acclimation response. However, there is ongoing debate about whether the acclimation response is associated with fitness costs, and what factors can affect the consequences of acclimation are still unclear. To elucidate this, we sought to determine whether fitness costs varied with acclimation conditions in two cereal aphids, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Thus, the basal and inducible thermal tolerances (maximum critical temperature [CTmax]) and fitness traits (proportion of adult emergence, adult longevity, fecundity, and population parameters) of adult aphids were measured under three conditions of developmental acclimation: 1) 22 degrees C constant temperature (no acclimation), 2) 22 degrees C + 34 degrees C for 2 h per day (low daytime temperature), and 3) 22 degrees C + 38 degrees C for 2 h per day (high daytime temperature). We found that the thermal tolerances of both species were significantly higher following developmental acclimation, where higher basal and inducible thermal tolerances were observed in R. padi than in S. avenae. Low daytime temperature acclimation conditions (34 degrees C) resulted in negligible reproductive costs and improved the intrinsic rates of population increase in both species. In contrast, substantial fitness costs were detected in both species in response to high daytime temperature acclimation (38 degrees C), especially for S. avenae. Our results indicate that the effects of acclimation conditions on fitness costs differ between the two aphid species.

Due to the unique morphology of females, this fly has become one of the most serious pests of thin-skinned fruits including blueberry, blackberry, cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. Prophylactic insecticide applications are commonly used to control this fly. A more sustainable approach to managing this invasive pest may not be possible without a clear understanding of the biology of this species under extreme environmental conditions. Specifically, high temperature is known to interfere with development and reproduction of drosophilids; however, the impact of high temperature on D. suzukii needs to be further investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of exposure to constant and relatively short-term heat stress on reproductive success of D. suzukii, and potential for recovery. Results show that the development and reproduction of D. suzukii were negatively affected by constant and relatively short-term heat stress. Under constant heat stress, oviposition rate and adult lifespan decreased as temperature increased from 24 degrees C to 33 degrees C and reproduction was completely absent at 33 degrees C. Under relatively short-term heat stress, oviposition, pupation, and adult eclosion were significantly decreased as temperature increased from 28 degrees C to 34 degrees C. The short-term heat stress greatly reduced the fertility of both male and female D. suzukii which was recovered eight days after treatment.

For Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae), an invasive agricultural pest, previous studies have estimated net reproductive rate (R.), generation time (T), and intrinsic rate of population increase (rm). A main limitation is that these estimates were measured under relatively favorable settings, and do not reflect environmental conditions and physiological states encountered during dormancy periods. Therefore, this study investigated the impacts of 1) low temperatures and 2) dietary protein: carbohydrate ratios (P:C) on both survival and fecundity parameters of D. suzukii summer morphs (SM) and postoverwintering winter morphs (WM) over physiological age (degree-days, DD). In both morphs, reproductive rates were higher and lifespan was longer when flies were exposed to low protein (P:C 1:4) or carbohydrate-only diets (P:C 0:1) compared with high protein diets (P:C 1:1). WM had higher reproductive rates and longer generation times than SM on optimal 1:4 diet in all trialed temperatures, but at the lowest temperatures, SM had higher reproductive rates than WM in carbohydrate-only and high protein diets.This likely reflected delayed oogenesis and hindered reproduction after an overwintering period in WM receiving suboptimal diets. Oviposition for SM and WM receiving 1:4 diet commenced from 0 to 100 DD, and peaked between 400 and 500 DD, earlier than flies receiving 0:1 diet. These results suggest that dietary protein has a crucial role in early oogenesis, particularly for postoverwintering WM. The parameters developed here reflect the population dynamics of D. suzukii before and after the crop growing season, an essential time for population buildup, survival, and early and late host infestation.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1536-2442,2250-2645,2018,10.1093/jisesa/iey113,WOS:000450731900002

Methodology : The experiment was conducted under digitally controlled walk-in-type plant growth chamber. The impact of six alternating temperatures (Max : Min) viz. 25:10, 25:13, 25:16, 30:10, 30:13 and 30:16 degrees C were studied on approximate digestibility and efficiency of conversion of ingested food into body substance of three final larval instars of H. armigera on tomato crop. Various observations like food consumption, weight of feces and larval insect were recorded daily till pre-pupal stage and recorded data were used in mathematical equations to calculate approximate digestibility and efficiency of conversion of ingested food into body substance. Results : Both, approximate digestibility and efficiency of conversion of ingested food into body substance values responded with respect to change in alternating temperatures. Approximate digestibility values followed an increasing trend from 8.675 to 31.432 % with increase in temperature from 25:10 to 25:16 degrees C. The increasing trend of approximate digestibility continued with rise in temperature from 30:10 to 30:16 degrees C. However, efficiency of conversion of ingested food into body substance values declined gradually from 14.993 to 9.371 % with rise in temperature from 25:10 to 30:16 degrees C.

The level of host parasitism by the mermithid was positively correlated with rainfall and negatively influenced by maximum temperature. Molecular analysis of the partial 185 small ribosomal subunit gene region and phylogenetic analysis with other mermithid sequences available in the GenBank indicated that the present nematode clustered with other nematodes belonging to different genera and hence could not be attributed to a specific genus. The pairwise Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) distance revealed that the closest taxon to the study nematode was an undescribed mermithid species reported to infect slugs with a K2P distance of 0.009.

We sampled the pest at different heights and at different distances from the forest, from the the winter dormancy stage to the post-harvest period. 3 Drosophila suzukii activity-density in the orchards declined strongly with increasing distance from the forest margin and with increasing height above the ground. The observed patterns varied over the crop phenological development stages, indicating that the pest used multiple habitats throughout the year. When the host plant was not suitable for reproduction, D. suzukii preferred to fly closer to the forest margin and at lower heights. When the host plant was suitable (i.e. ripe cherries), D. suzukii further colonized the orchards both horizontally and vertically, exploring the canopy volume more in depth. 4 The results of the present study will contribute to the development of more effective and practical approaches for protecting fruit crops from D. suzukii and improving chemical, physical or mechanical control measures.",no,,,,,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1461-9555,1461-9563,2018,10.1111/afe.12290,WOS:000446159200012

Here we integrated, for the first time, the slow-fast thermal strategies stemming from the pace-of-life into a mechanistic predictive framework. We obtained 4619 phenological observations of an important crop pest in the Bolivian Andes by individually following 840 individuals under five rearing temperatures and across nine life stages. The model calibrated with the observed individual pace-of-life strategies showed a higher accuracy in phenological predictions than when accounting for intrapopulational variability alone. We further explored our framework with generated data and suggest that ectotherm species with a high number of life stages and with slow and/or fast individuals should exhibit a greater variance of populational phenology, resulting in a potentially longer time window of interaction with other species.

Smith (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is common in the eastern United States and Canada but occurs as far west as Alberta, Colorado, and Texas. Larvae are conspicuously colored, with distinctive red heads, white or yellow mid-dorsal tufts of hairs, and a black mid-dorsal stripe flanked by yellow subdorsal stripes. Larvae feed on at least 140 species of deciduous and coniferous woody plants, demonstrating tolerance to a wide variety of plant defensive compounds. This species is not a major forest pest but does exhibit periodic outbreaks that can cause serious defoliation. However, it often is a pest of shade trees, walnut orchards, poplar and Christmas tree plantations, and blueberry crops, and its urticating larval hairs and setae can cause dermatitis and allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This species is likely to become more important in a warmer climate, warranting greater attention to its population dynamics and control options. Variation in temperature, host condition, and mortality agents appear to be responsible for changes in abundance. Maintaining tree vigor and planting resistant varieties are nonchemical options for management. When control is necessary, application of microbial pathogens, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, is effective and favored over synthetic insecticides. Other biorational insecticides include azadirachtin (a botanical insecticide) and insecticidal soap. Conventional synthetic insecticides include several pyrethroids (such as bifenthrin and permethrin), organophosphates (such as acephate and malathion), and carbamates (carbaryl).

This study examined the effects of future climate change on three key phenological events of O. cornifrons: date for adult emergence (female and male) in spring, date for completion of egg and larval development, and duration for the development in the Eastern USA. We used daily temperature data obtained from 21 models in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 for 2006-2100 under the two future climate scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). We estimated the Julian dates (JDs) of spring emergence and development of O. cornifrons using the phenological parameters derived from temperature-dependent biophysical models. The JDs for the bee emergence and development are projected to be significantly advanced in the Eastern USA under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios.

Faster heating rates improved critical thermal maxima (CTmax) in C. partellus larvae and adult C. partellus and C. sesamiae. Lower cooling rates improved critical thermal minima (CTmin) in C. partellus and C. sesamiae adults while compromising CTmin in C. partellus larvae.

The slug counts were compared with meteorological data from 5:00 in the morning on the day of observation (OT- and OD-models) and the day before observation (DBOD-models). The OT- and OD-models were more supported than the DBOD-models based on the WAIC scores, and the meteorological predictors selected in the OT-, OD- and DBOD-models were different. The probability of slug appearance was increased on mornings with higher than 20-year-average humidity (%) and lower than average wind velocity (m/s) and precipitation (mm) values in the OT-models. OD-models showed a pattern similar to OT-models in the probability of slug appearance, but also suggested other meteorological predictors for slug activities; positive effect of solar radiation (MJ) for example. Five meteorological predictors, mean and highest temperature (degrees C), wind velocity (m/s), precipitation amount (mm) and atmospheric pressure (hPa), were selected as the effective factors for the counts in the DBOD-models.

Most studies on B. cucurbitae have focussed on the effects of prolonged high temperature and very few have examined the effects of short-term exposures to high-temperature on behaviour. Results In this study, short-term of high-temperature treatments of 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 41 degrees C and 45 degrees C were maintained for 1-3hr, and long-term, variable high-temperature treatments were established that consisted of experienced one, two and three times high temperatures stages to 31 degrees C, 33 degrees C, 34 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 36 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 41 degrees C and 45 degrees C for 7hr. We compared the effects of the different high temperatures regimes changes treatments on the mating, oviposition and thermotactic taxis of the flies. The results showed that exposure to a 45 degrees C/1hr treatment, delayed both initiation of mating and oviposition for 8 hr relative to the control but mating and was observed 41 times and oviposition 47 times. By comparison, in the control, mating commenced immediately and was observed 38.3 times and oviposition was observed 41.3 times. Under the other treatments, all the indices for the flies declined with the increase in temperature and duration of exposure. Conclusion Results showed that 1hr of exposure to 45 degrees C significantly stimulated mating, oviposition and thermotactic behaviour of the flies.

The objectives of this work were to monitor D. citri adult populations in Murraya paniculata (OJ) in urban areas and in Persian lime (LM) orchards, to estimate the effect of some environmental factors and to evaluate the synchronization between these populations. Sampling was performed from September 2012 to August 2014 in Veracruz, Mexico. Five urban areas and five commercial Persian lime plots close to each other were selected. Adult D. citri catches were made monthly with yellow traps. Vegetative shoots, temperature and relative humidity were measured throughout the sampling period. Adults of Diaphorina citri were captured in all the sampling sites throughout the two-years sampling period and the populations were more abundant in summer. Significant factors affecting trap catches were the presence of new shoots and temperature. Temperature and relative humidity enclosed a comfort zone between 26 and 28 degrees C and 75 to 85% respectively. Cross-correlation values were positive across hosts within the same locations and between locations, regardless of the distance, thus suggesting a spatial synchronization in trap catches.

In particular, in temperate regions changes in spring temperatures have a major impact on crop pest population dynamics, but the mechanisms remain elusive. By analysing empirical data of Helicoverpa armigera moth populations from three sites over 12-13 years in northwestern China, and running modelling (DYMEX software), we intended to clarify how the late spring cold (LSC) events affect the populations of this destructive pest species. We then explored the relationships between LSC parameters and moth population dynamics using model simulations. Our results highlight the importance of LSC in driving H. armigera population dynamics. Of the LSC parameters tested, the duration of LSC measured as the maximum continuous days with a minimum temperature lower than 10 degrees C (MCDL) was a key factor influencing the population abundance of the spring and summer generations. Furthermore, the model showed that the timing of the LSC event had a major effect on how the MCDL influenced each generation. The timing with respect to the eclosion of the overwintering generation was critical, and it determined the variation in the abundance of the first and subsequent generations. Our findings imply that the abundance of H. armigera will increase as the frequency and duration of LSC events decrease under global spring warming.

J,"Iltis, C; Martel, G; Thiery, D; Moreau, J; Louapre, P",When warmer means weaker: high temperatures reduce behavioural and immune defences of the larvae of a major grapevine pest,"Phytophagous insects evolving in agroecosystems express numerous defences when faced with myriads of natural enemies. Such defensive traits might impair the effectiveness of biological control relying on these natural enemies, mostly parasitoids. In the case of parasitoid threat, these defences consist of the avoidance of the parasitoid (reduced exposure to antagonists through shortening of developmental time), hindrance of oviposition (evasive behaviours and morphological protection) or destruction of the parasitoid eggs (encapsulation and melanisation by means of the immune system). Previous works focused on one defensive trait only when investigating the effects of temperature on host resistance. By doing so, they assumed that all defensive traits would respond uniformly to a change occurring in thermal environment, which remains an undocumented fact. To test this assumption in the context of global warming, we adopted a global overview of host resistance by examining the effects of rising temperatures on multiple defensive traits used by the grape pest, Lobesia botrana, against its larval parasitoids. Although warmer conditions led to reduced exposure to parasitoids by accelerating larval development, warmer conditions also elicited extensive weakening of behavioural and immune defences. These results confirm that temperatures might differently modulate the levels of expression of several defensive traits. An increase in growth rate and pupal mass also occurred, especially for females, which may contribute to greater pest fecundity in the future. However, the decline of L. botrana resistance might enhance the efficiency of the biological control naturally exerted by parasitoids in vineyards, thereby limiting the damage to crops.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1612-4758,1612-4766,2018,10.1007/s10340-018-0992-y,WOS:000440114600013

Transgenic cotton varieties provided resistance to a variety of insects pests. But, these are not safe for this emerging potential threat. In present study, nine transgenic cotton varieties (IUB-222, MNH-886, FH-142, CIM-599, A-555, CIM-602, NIAB-777, MNH-786 and Bt-666) were assessed for seasonal population dynamics of dusky cotton bug (DCB) under field conditions. All transgenic varieties showed a differential DCB population over the months and no transgenic variety was free from DCB population throughout the crop duration. DCB population appeared during 3rd week of July and crossed the economic threshold level (10-15 nymph/ adults or both per plant) during August. A substantial increase in DCB population was noted during September-November with its peak population during October, 2014. Among all varieties, three varieties (CIM-599, CIM-602 & IUB-222) showed a significantly lower mean population per plant (37.76, 37.87, 43.84) and two varieties (FH-142, MNH-886) gave highest population (44.71, 46.81), respectively. Correlation matrix revealed that low temperature and high humidity were promoting the DCB population. Cluster analysis revealed interesting findings that IUB-222 with least population fall in a cluster where other two varieties (FH-142 & MNH-886) possessed highest population. Moreover, two varieties (CIM-599 & CIM-602) with least population fall in second cluster regarding DCB population. These findings would be helpful for the farmers to select the varieties that showed relatively higher resistance towards DCB population and to adopt proper management strategies keeping in view the trend of DCB population during the crop season.

The goal of this work is to investigate D. suzukii dispersal ability during different times of the season, and along an elevational gradient in a mountain valley in Trentino Province, Italy.

Genetic analysis further revealed that samples collected during autumn at different elevations belong to the same population. These results show that D. suzukii are able to fly up to about 9000 m away from the marking point and that seasonal breezes likely facilitate long-distance movement.

We examined diapause incidence and associated survival for weevils fed for 7, 14, or 21 d after adult eclosion. Diapause incidence of females was less influenced by feeding duration compared with males. For males, highest diapause incidence occurred after 14 d of feeding compared with 7 or 21 d. Host-free survival tended to be higher after 14 d of feeding compared with 7 or 21 d, although many weevils were long-lived (>= 80 d) after each feeding period duration. Males exhibited higher survival compared with females, and survival was higher for weevils fed large flower buds (squares) compared with smaller squares. Survival was most influenced by temperature; longevity increased with decreasing temperature except at the lowest temperature (12.8 degrees C).

After removing the influence of disturbance events during this time period to isolate the impact of climate, we identified five climate metrics that were significantly related to sugar maple crown condition. While three of these are monthly summary metrics commonly used in climate analyses (minimum April, August and October temperatures), two are novel metrics designed to capture extreme climate events (periods of unusual warmth in January and August). The proportion of climate-driven variability in canopy condition is comparable to the proportion accounted for by defoliating pests and other disturbance events. This indicates that climate conditions, though rarely included in sugar maple decline studies, may be of equal importance as more traditionally studied stress agents. Modeled across the state, results indicate that changes in historical climatic conditions have negatively impacted sugar maple health over the 25 year study period, and are likely to degrade further over time. Climate projections under a low emissions scenario indicated that by 2071 55% of sugar maple across the state would likely experience moderate to severe climate-driven stress relative to historic baselines, increasing to 84% under a high emissions scenario.

The influences of these major drivers can only be identified by analyzing long-term data. This study examines panel data on land use, adoption of genetically modified Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insect-resistant cotton, weather, pest severity, and insecticide use on three major cotton pests for 51 counties in China during 1991-2015. Bt cotton had pervasive effects on the whole pest complex in cotton and its management. Adoption resulted in major reductions in insecticide use for bollworm control. The resulting restoration of aphid biological control decreased aphid severity. However, mirid bugs, which have few effective natural enemies in cotton, increased in severity with warming May and reduced insecticide spraying against bollworm. The effects of landscape on pest severity were pest specific. The severity of cotton aphid and mirid bugs decreased with higher land use diversity, but the severity of highly polyphagous cotton bollworm was unrelated to land use diversity. Shares of forest, water body, and unused land area were negatively associated with the severity of mirid bugs, whereas cotton bollworm responded positively to the shares of water body and unused land area. Farmers sprayed insecticides at mild infestation levels and responded aggressively to severe bollworm outbreaks.

Although this slug has been problematic for decades, there is still not much known about its occurrence across private gardens and the underlying meteorological and ecological factors. One reason for this knowledge gap is the limited access of researchers to private gardens. Here we used a citizen science approach to overcome this obstacle and examined whether the occurrence of Arionidae in Austrian gardens was associated with meteorological (air temperature, precipitation, global solar radiation, relative humidity) or ecological factors (plant diversity, earthworm activity). Occurrence of the invasive A. vulgaris versus the similar-looking native A. rufus was compared using a DNA-barcoding approach. Results: Slugs were collected from 1061 gardens from the dry Pannonian lowland to the wet alpine climate (altitudinal range 742 m). Slug abundance in gardens was best explained and negatively associated with the parameters sum of the mean air temperature in spring,number of frost days in the previous winterand mean daily global solar radiation on the day of data collection. Precipitation, plant diversity and earthworm activity were also related to slug abundance, but positively. Out of our genetic sampling of collected slugs, 92% belonged to A. vulgaris.

In insects of temperate latitudes, water availability at the end of winter, in interaction with temperature, could control the resumption of development for insect stages in postdiapause quiescence. The balsam twig aphid, Mindarus abietinus Koch (Hemiptera: Aphididae), overwinters as eggs in southern Quebec, Canada, on balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.) Miller (Pinaceae), in Christmas tree plantations, where it is known as a pest. Previous work has shown that eggs of this aphid maintain low water content during winter, presumably to survive sub-zero temperatures. Conversely, in late winter and early spring, they passively or actively absorb surrounding moisture, which is accompanied by notable changes in size, shape, and fresh mass. The primary objective here was to determine the embryonic stage at which winter diapause starts and is maintained in M.abietinus, a relatively primitive aphid. Secondly, we tested the hypothesis that free water availability to postdiapause eggs, in combination with temperatures above developmental threshold, is essential for embryonic development and hatching, by experimentally soaking field-collected eggs in water at controlled frequencies. We observed that embryogenesis starts at the time of egg laying and stops after a few days, before the anatrepsis stage of blastokinesis is complete, when the germ band has not yet entirely immersed itself into the yolk. We also found that water surrounding overwintered eggs on fir shoots, in interaction with temperature regime, significantly increases M.abietinus egg hatching rates.

In this study, we analyzed the seasonal variation of captures and field distribution of sterile A.ludens released in different seasons of the year in north-eastern Mexico. Chilled releases were conducted by air at constant densities per ha on a citrus area for a period of 32weeks that included the coldest and warmest seasons that is winter, spring and summer. Multilure traps baited with torula yeast pellets were used to capture sterile flies. Fly capture data were compared over the three seasons and correlated with climate. The lowest number of captures of the sterile insect occurred in the summer and the highest in winter and spring. High and low temperatures were negatively correlated with fly captures. Field distribution was also negatively correlated with high temperatures in summer, but no relationships were observed in winter and spring. No relationships were observed between rainfall with capture and field distribution of sterile flies.

Its larvae mine the leaves and are best managed by targeted sprays. Little is known about its thermal development characteristics, thus, immature P. ringoniella development was investigated under eight constant temperatures (13.3, 15.3, 20.7, 23.6, 26.1, 30.0, 32.3, and 35.0 degrees C) in the laboratory. The total developmental period of the immature stage (egg-pupa) was inversely related to temperature and decreased from 76.4 d at 13.3 degrees C to 25.9 d at 26.1 degrees C. The developmental periods of eggs, larvae, and pupae ranged from 4.8 to 15.2, 15.5 to 40.3, and 5.7 to 21.6 d, respectively Eggs, larvae, and pupae did not survive at 35.0 degrees C.

Here, we compare a suite of degree-day models to assess their ability to predict the phenology of a common, oligophagous butterfly, the silver-spotted skipper, Epargyreus clarus (Cramer) (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae). To estimate model parameters, we used development time of eggs and larvae reared in the laboratory at six constant temperatures ranging from 8 to 38 degrees C and on two host plants of contrasting quality (kudzu and wisteria). We employed three approaches to determine the base temperature to calculate degree days: linear regression, modified reduced major axis regression, and application of a generic base temperature value of 10 degrees C, which is commonly used in the absence of laboratory data. To calculate the number of degree days required to complete a developmental stage, we used data from caterpillars feeding on high- and low-quality hosts, both in the field and in the laboratory. To test model accuracy, we predicted development time of seven generations of larvae reared in the field on the same host plants across 3 years (2014-2016). To compare performance among models, we regressed predicted vs. observed development time, and found that r(2) values were significantly larger when accounting for host plant quality. The accuracy of development time predictions varied across the season, with estimates of the first two generations being more accurate than estimates of the third generation, when ambient temperatures dropped outside the range in which development rate and temperature have a linear relationship.

The results showed that a warming climate advanced the phenology of cotton bollworm larvae and cotton flowering. However, the phenological rate of change was faster in cotton bollworm larvae than that in cotton flowering, and the larval period was prolonged, resulting in a great increase of the larval population. The abrupt phenological changes in cotton bollworm larvae occurred earlier than that in cotton, and the abrupt phenological changes in cotton flowering occurred earlier than that in larval abundance. However, the timing of abrupt changes in larval abundance all occurred later than that in temperature. Thus, the abrupt changes that occurred in larvae, cotton flowering and climate were asynchronous.

We modelled development of S. rubrovittatus in the field applying the effective accumulated temperature model to calculate the theoretical number of generations and the egg hatching dates from 2003 to 2012 based on a high-resolution, daily weather database. We then performed a regional analysis to assess the relationship between population dynamics and range expansion across the study region and also included a local analysis to evaluate how population parameters affect the presence of S. rubrovittatus at local sites in each year. Results showed that distribution expanded with a relative increase in voltinism and with synchrony of egg hatching date. Moreover, we showed that increased voltinism in the previous year positively influenced local population occurrence. This positive effect suggests that the species' distribution range expands through increased reproduction at both the regional and local scale. Climate-mediated population dynamics play a significant role in range expansion of the mirid bug. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

In a climate change context, increased warming and dryness will likely affect arthropod communities of agro-ecosystems managed by biological pest control. In this work, we compare, at the individual level, the functional relation between temperature and relative humidity and different life-history parameters in two sister predatory mite species that inhabit Spanish avocado crops, Euseius stipulatus and E. scutalis (Athias-Henriot) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). We found that negative effects of high temperature and low relative humidity were stronger in E. stipulatus than in E. scutalis.

Predicting the insect's flight phenology during the growing season is critical to improve Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tactics through better timing of sampling or control operations. The aim of this study was to characterize the flight phenology of L. botrana in Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) in Portugal, as well as to develop degree-day (DD) models for predicting main pest flights, based on data of male catches in sex pheromone traps and temperature data recorded over a 20-year period. Nonlinear models based on Boltzmann regression equations were developed using the cumulative percentage of male catches and accumulated DD, considering two starting points for this accumulation, a biofix (first male catch) and a calendar date (January 1st), both using 7.3 degrees C and 33 degrees C as lower and upper thresholds, respectively. The results obtained suggest that the cumulative percentage of L. botrana catches and accumulated DD are highly related, using both events as starting points for DD accumulation, although, in the case of the second and third flights, the best correlations were obtained using the model developed from January 1st. Although the use of a biofix seems to improve model's accuracy, from the practical point of view and considering large scale application for an IPM strategy, the use of a fixed calendar date (January 1st) should be preferred. These results could be useful in timing L. botrana control measures, especially biorational pesticides applications that require accurate information on insect phenology to be effective.",no,,,,,CROP PROTECTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0261-2194,1873-6904,2018,10.1016/j.cropro.2017.12.006,WOS:000432761300007

Aphids are vulnerable to climate warming because ambient temperature strongly affects their life history traits. We used the large cotton aphid (Acyrthosiphon gossypii M.) as a model insect to provide insights into the responses of mid-latitude (temperate zone) aphids exposed to high temperature events. The developmental time, survival and fecundity of individual A. gossypii were measured under five temperature regimes. Even though the mean daily temperature was the same (24 degrees C) for all temperature regimes, the impact of temperature fluctuations to extreme levels (36 degrees C) on aphid fitness was clearly different to the impact of constant temperature. Negative effects on the aphid's life history traits occurred under all four fluctuating temperature regimes. Our study shows that cooler intervals may help the insect to tolerate potentially lethal high temperatures under naturally occurring conditions.

In order to test the hypothesis of an adaptive role for plasticity in invasions, particular attention should be paid to the relationship between the focal plastic trait, the environmental stimulus and the functional importance of the trait. The Drosophila wing is particularly amenable to experimental studies of phenotypic plasticity. Wing morphology is known for its plastic variation under different experimental temperatures, but this plasticity has rarely been investigated in a functional context of flight. Here, we investigate the effect of temperature on wing morphology and flight in the invasive pest species Drosophila suzukii. Although the rapid invasion of both Europe and North America was most likely facilitated by human activities, D. suzukii is also expected to disperse actively. By quantifying wing morphology and individual flight trajectories of flies raised under different temperatures, we tested whether (1) invasive populations of D. suzukii show higher phenotypic plasticity than their native counterparts, and (2) wing plasticity affects flight parameters. Developmental temperature was found to affect both wing morphology and flight parameters (in particular speed and acceleration), leaving open the possibility of an adaptive value for wing plasticity.

Temperature has an impact on the survival, development, reproduction, and migration initiation of insects. Previous research has primarily been focused on the effects of constant temperature on populations, but changing temperature has received less attention. Three constant temperature treatments (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three pupal-alternating temperature treatments (20-25, 25-20 and 25-30 degrees C) were set up to study the relationship between temperature and population development by age-stage, two-sex life table analysis in the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata Walker, a notorious migratory pest in grain crops. The 25 degrees C treatment was considered optimal with 20 and 30 degrees C as low suitable temperature and high temperatures, respectively. The survival rate was relatively low before third instar larvae at 20 degrees C (63.0%) and 20-25 degrees C (70.1 %), and extreme low after pupal stage at 30 degrees C (20.6%). Developmental duration of each stage was negatively correlated with temperature.

The present increase in the pest numbers started in 2011-2012, 14 years after the previous mass outbreak. As a result, the area of damage to dark coniferous forests exceeded 1.4 million ha. The reasons for the emergence of the pest population from a depressive state are insufficient moisture availability in May 2011, severe droughts in June-July 2012, and increased mean monthly temperature. A significant decrease in the vegetation index of SWVI occurred in 2011-2012. The hydrothermal regime of the spring-summer period in these years promoted the transition of most of the pest populations to development over 1-year generation. One exceptional feature of the current outbreak is low damage to D. sibiricus caterpillars by diseases and parasites. Favorable weather conditions and a low number of natural entomopathogens contribute to the rapid spread of the pest in northern and eastern directions. This creates a high risk of mass outbreak of D. sibiricus in dark coniferous forests, since the area of nearby dark coniferous stands suitable in structure, climatic, and forest-growing conditions for the pest dispersal is more than 2.7 million ha. Pure cultures of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana were isolated from dead caterpillars of D. sibiricus. Multistage screening made it possible to select a promising strain for the creation of a long-acting bioinsecticide for the preventive treatment of forests.

I sere we apply a process-based (biophysical) model that incorporates climate data with life stage-dependent physiology and life history to attempt to predict Eldana saccharina life stage and generation turnover in sugarcane fields. Fitness traits are modelled at two agricultural locations in South Africa that differ in average temperature (hereafter a cold and a warm site). We test whether the life stage population structures in the field entering winter and local climate during winter directly affect development rates, and therefore interact to determine the population dynamics and phenological responses of E. saccharina in subsequent spring and summer seasons. The model predicts that: (1) E. saccharina can cycle through more generations at the warm site where fewer hours of cold and heat stress are endured, and (2) at the cold site, overwintering as pupae (rather than larvae) confer higher relative fitness and fecundity in the subsequent summer adult moths.

In most cases, the fitness cost in resistant insects is often evaluated under laboratory conditions for insect development, which limits its practical application in pest control in the field. In a laboratory population R9 with 253-fold resistance to chlorpyrifos after nine-generation selection with chlorpyrifos, the relative fitness was only 0.206 under laboratory conditions (25 degrees C, humidity 70%-80% and 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod), when compared to S9, a susceptible counterpart (resistance ratio = 2.25-fold) from the same origin as R9 but without any selection with insecticides. Temperatures varied the resistance-associated fitness costs, with enhanced costs at high temperatures and reduced costs at low temperatures, such as 0.174 at 32 degrees C and 0.527 at 18 degrees C. The copulation rate and fecundity were two key factors for the reduced costs at low temperatures. Another finding was that R9 individuals needed much more time to recover from heat shock than that of S9, but R9 and S9 individuals were similarly sensitive to cold shock. The low fitness cost at low temperatures would increase the overwintering population, which might further increase risks of rapid development and widespread distribution of chlorpyrifos resistance in Nilaparvata lugens.",no,,,,,INSECT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1672-9609,1744-7917,2018,10.1111/1744-7917.12432,WOS:000433574500006

While it can survive the acute effects of subzero (degrees C) temperatures, it is poorly understood how exposure to infrequent cold temperatures affects postdiapause survival and behavior. We studied the impacts of episodic cold shock at temperatures of -6 to -2 (degrees C) at the onset of H. halys diapause, followed by an extended overwintering period.These conditions simulated three distinct climates, with above-freezing, near-freezing, and below-freezing daily low temperatures, to explore a range of possible effects on H. halys. We measured mortality regularly and evaluated postdiapause feeding damage and fecundity in each treatment. Postdiapause survival rates ranged from 40 to 50% in all treatments, except for -6 degrees C. At this temperature, fewer than 25% H. halys survived. Feeding damage was greatest in the warmest simulated climate. The highest number of egg masses was laid under subfreezing episodic cold shock conditions. The controlled diapause simulations suggest that brief exposure to cold temperatures as low as -4 degrees C does not have immediate or long-term effects on H. halys mortality.

In nature, these insects are often exposed to multiple environmental stressors, resulting in potent impact on their thermal tolerance. Such environmental stressors may influence their activity, survival, abundance and biogeography. In the present study, we investigate the effects of acclimation to temperature, starvation and desiccation on thermal tolerance, measured as critical thermal limits [critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax)] on laboratory-reared economic pest species Chilo partellus Swinhoe (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Busseola fusca (Fuller) and Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) using established protocols. Low temperature acclimation results in improved CTmin for B. fusca and C. partellus, whereas high temperature acclimation enhances the same trait for B. fusca and S. calamistis. Similarly, high temperature and starvation pretreatment improve CTmax for C. partellus relative to S. calamistis and B. fusca. In addition, starvation and desiccation pretreatments improve CTmin for all stemborer species. Furthermore, rapid cold-hardening (RCH) enhancs CTmin for B. fusca and C. partellus, whereas rapid heat-hardening (RHH) improves the same trait for C. partellus. However, RCH and RHH impair CTmax for all stemborer species. These findings show differential thermal tolerances after exposure to heterogeneous environmental stress habitats. Chilo partellus, of exotic origin, shows a higher magnitude of basal thermal tolerance plasticity relative to the indigenous African species S. calamistis and B. fusca.

Mechanisms facilitating this survival in subtropical and tropical areas are incompletely known, and our understanding has been further complicated by recent reports of overwintering on noncotton hosts. In addition, the nature and even existence of the adult dormancy, and validity of the criteria used to distinguish it, have been questioned. We manipulated the boll weevil diet to produce a range of diapause responses and observed the corresponding host-free survival patterns. The estimated proportion of diapause was associated with subsequent survival. In addition, different diets producing similar incidences of diapause resulted in substantially different host-free longevity, and the longest survival was observed for weevils fed bolls as adults. Survival patterns exhibited a negative temperature dependence except for the lowest observed temperature (12.8 degrees C), where survival was reduced compared with that at 18.3 degrees C. This suggests chronic chilling injury in response to extended exposure to low, above freezing temperatures. All but the highest temperature (29.4 degrees C) facilitated survival >6 mo, and survival of >1 yr was observed at 18.3 degrees C.

Temperature is arguably the most important factor affecting metabolism and growth rate in insects. Here, we investigated how rearing temperature affected growth rate, growth efficiency and macronutrient composition in two species of edible beetle larvae: Alphitobius diaperinus and Tenebrio molitor. Growth rates of both species were quantified at temperatures ranging from 15.2 to 38.0 degrees C after which we measured protein and lipid content of the different treatment groups. Metabolic rate was measured in a similar temperature range by measuring the rate of O-2 consumption (VO2) and CO2 production (VCO2) using repeated measures closed respirometry. Using these measurements, we calculated the growth efficiency of mealworms by relating the energy assimilation rate to the metabolic rate. Maximum daily growth rates were 18.3% and 16.6% at 31 degrees C, for A. diaperinus and T. molitor respectively, and we found that A. diaperinus was better at maintaining growth at high temperatures while T. molitor had superior growth at lower temperatures.

Roughly half of time series exhibited a long-term trend, and agricultural pests were more likely to be declining, while forest pests were more likely to be increasing. Approximately one quarter of records exhibited periodic oscillations, and we used their statistical properties to infer whether the oscillations were environmentally forced or arose from density dependence.

The highest dominance of A. ustulatus was recorded in the warmest eastern county and the species was classified as eudominant. High dominance was also observed in the western county, confirming that A. ustulatus occurs in higher population in this area. Species was subdominant where the mean air temperature was the lowest. The increase in dominance in the west could be explained by the significant positive correlation found between air temperature and dominance. The seasonal activity of the adults was from June to mid-August, with peak flight at the end of June.",no,,,,,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1461-9555,1461-9563,2018,10.1111/afe.12259,WOS:000429089600017

Therefore, the aim was the evaluation of traps with lures and their efficacy for monitoring and mass trapping of Xylotrechus arvicola. Methods and Results: Three trap types, Crosstrap, Delta and Screen-adhesive, with lures baited with ethanol, were evaluated during 4 years in vineyards of two cultivars. The Crosstrap obtained the greatest catches during 2013 in Tempranillo (29.6 adults/trap) and Prieto Picudo (12.9 adults/trap). All trap types showed similar periods of greatest catches in both cultivars. Conclusions: The Crosstrap achieved the greatest number of adults captured in both cultivars. The Delta and Screen-adhesive had few catches. The Tempranillo has proved to be more susceptible to attack by this insect than Prieto Picudo. The capture period varies from 30 to 50 days in the same cultivar in different years. Low temperature during spring delays the appearance of adults. Significance of the Study: The Crosstrap baited with ethanol captured the greatest number of X. arvicola adults.

It feeds on several timber species and can cause major damage when it infests lumber. Termites are urban pests: they are often found in and around towns and their expansion is closely linked to human activity. Although, by law, termite infestations must be reported and treated, R. flavipes continues to spread. To better identify areas that may soon be colonized, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the termite's spread at a fine spatial scale. However, the complexity of the species' dispersal dynamics (i.e., via swarming, budding, or human-mediated transport of infested material) and social organization render this process difficult. The goal of our study was to determine R. flavipes' potential to expand its current range within a region of France: Centre-Val de Loire. We focused on one administrative department within the region-Indre and Loire-where infestations are common and data on termite presence date back to the 1980s. We developed a spatiotemporal model to study the growth and dispersal of termite colonies within favorable habitat. Habitat favorability was defined based on the density of urbanization and annual mean minimum temperature. First, we modeled temporal population dynamics, using biological parameters describing the transitions between life stages/castes within colonies; we could thus estimate alates production. Then, using this information, we modeled termite dispersal within favorable habitat, and determined the termite's potential spread. We validated the results by comparing the model's output with actual data on the termite's range expansion between 1985 (when the termite was first observed in the region) and 2013. Finally, the model was used to predict the termite's future spread given climate warming for the period from 2013 to 2030. The results show that an increase in temperature should increase the amount of favorable habitat and, as a consequence, termites could continue to spread within this region. In addition to continuing current control efforts, it will be necessary to enact preventative strategies in newly favorable habitat. In these areas, monitoring efforts should therefore be intensified, as they might be able to slow down the termite's spread and limit its impact.",no,,,,,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1387-3547,1573-1464,2018,10.1007/s10530-017-1581-3,WOS:000428955000008

We did a laboratory experiment in Slovakia to study the response of major pest beetles of oak and their parasitoids to different temperature regimes as background for predicting climatic effects and improving management tools of European oak forests. With higher temperatures the most important oak pest Scolytus intricatus emerged much earlier, which indicate that completion of a second generation and increased damage further north in European oak forests may be possible. Lower temperatures gave longer larval galleries and more offspring per parents but still lower beetle production due to semivoltine life cycle. For buprestids and longhorn beetles warmer temperatures resulted in more emerging offspring and a shift towards earlier emergence in the same season, but no emergence in the first season indicated that a change to univoltine populations is not likely. Reduced development success of parasitoids at the highest temperatures (25/30 A degrees C) indicates a loss of population regulation for pest beetle populations. A warmer climate may lead to invasion of other population-regulating parasitoids, but also new serious pest may invade.

These changes will influence the growth of both crop plants and herbivores. The effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), feeding on maize, Zea mays L., were examined in environmentally controlled chambers. Elevated CO2 decreased N content and increased total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) content and the TNC: N ratio in maize leaves. Developmental time of larvae, protonymphs, deutonymphs, and the entire immature development of T. urticae was reduced at elevated temperatures, while elevated CO2 slightly mitigated the effects of elevated temperature on developmental time. The fecundity of T. urticae declined under elevated CO2 and temperature. Tetranychus urticae had lower net reproductive rate and shorter generation time at elevated temperatures, regardless of CO2 level. These results indicate that elevated CO2-mediated decrease in nutritional quality of maize leaves extends the development time of T. urticae. Taken together, with the increase of CO2 and temperature, the growth and development was accelerated for T. urticae feeding on maize, but its fecundity declined, which will decrease the T. urticae damage to maize for each generation. However, the number of generations will increase in high accumulative temperature regions, which may exacerbate T. urticae damage to maize.

Megacopta cribraria Fabricius (Hemiptera: Plataspidae), kudzu bug, is a pest of soybeans first detected in the United States in 2009 and in Maryland in 2013. We observed the phenology of kudzu bug life stages in Maryland, created a Celsius degree-day (CDD) model for development, and characterized the difference between microhabitat and ambient temperatures of both kudzu, Pueraria montana (Lour.) Merr. (Fabales: Fabaceae) and soybeans, Glycine max (L.) Merrill (Fabales: Fabaceae). In 2014, low population numbers yielded limited resolution from field phenology observations. We observed kudzu bug populations persisting within Maryland; but between 2013 and 2016, populations were low compared to populations in the southeastern United States. Based on the degree-day model, kudzu bug eggs require 80 CDD at a minimum temperature of 14 degrees C to hatch. Nymphs require 545 CDD with a minimum temperature of 16 degrees C for development. The CDD model matches field observations when factoring a biofix date of April 1 and a minimum preoviposition period of 17 d. The model suggests two full generations per year in Maryland. Standard air temperature monitors do not affect model predictions for pest management, as microhabitat temperature differences did not show a clear trend between kudzu and soybeans.

However, predicting the impact of future heat waves on organisms and ecosystems is challenging because we still have a limited understanding of how the different components that characterize heat waves interact. Here we take an experimental approach to examine the individual and combine consequences of two important features that characterize heat waves: duration of successive hot days and recovery days between two hot spells. Specifically we exposed individuals of a global agricultural pest, the aphid Sitobion avenae to different heat wave scenarios by factorially manipulating the number of extreme hot days versus normal days and altered which period individuals experienced first in their life cycle. We found that effects of heat waves were driven by a delicate balance of damage during hot periods versus repair during normal periods. Increasing the duration of hot days in heat waves had a negative effect on various demographic rates and life-time fitness of individuals, but magnitude of this effect was typically contingent on the temporal clustering of hot periods. Importantly, this interaction effect indicates that changes in the temporal distribution of extreme hot versus normal days can strongly alter the performance of organisms and dynamics of populations even when the total number of hot days during a given period remains unchanged.

Climatic constraints may limit species distributions through their phenology and this seems particularly likely for figs, where phenological mismatches can cause local extinction of the short-lived pollinators. We therefore compared the phenologies of Ficus altissima, F. racemosa and F. semicordata in tropical Xishuangbanna (21 degrees 55'N) and subtropical Liuku (25 degrees 50'N), SW China, to understand what factors limit fig distributions near their northern limits. All species produced synchronous crops of syconia in Xishuangbanna but production in Liuku was continuous, which may help maintain pollinator populations. However, in general, we found decreased fitness at the northern site: slower syconium development, so fewer crops each year; fewer seeds per syconium (two species); and fewer pollinators and more non-pollinators per syconium, so less pollen is dispersed. This is most easily explained by colder winters, although low humidities may also contribute, and suggests the northern limit is set by temperature constraints on reproductive phenology. If so, the warming predicted for future decades is expected to enhance the fitness of northern populations of figs and, in the longer term, allow them to shift their range limits northwards.",no,,,,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2045-2322,NA,2018,10.1038/s41598-018-22548-7,WOS:000427115600007

Based on its continuous spread and expanded damage area in Asian countries such as Japan with high reproduction potential, it is highly likely that L. chinensis will become an important rice pest in the near future. However, limited information is available to predict its distribution and occurrence. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop models for their development and oviposition. We investigated the development of L. chinensis immatures (from egg to adult) at 11 constant temperatures ranging from 16.2 to 35.3 degrees C and the oviposition of female adults at five constant temperatures ranging from 22.3 to 35.3 degrees C in this study. For L. chinensis in-matures, the lower developmental threshold temperature, optimal developmental temperature, upper developmental threshold temperature were 12.7, 32.3, and 37.6 degrees C, respectively. The highest survival rate of immatures was observed at temperature of 25.2 degrees C and the highest mean total fecundity was 585.8 at 28.0 degrees C. This study provides basic information for the ecology of L. chinensis.

The present work was carried out to evaluate the seasonal population fluctuation of S. p. piceifrons and vegetation diversity and their association with weather factors and edaphic conditions in the gregarious zone of the Yucatan Peninsula. The study was performed in seven sites during three seasons: North-wind (December 2013), rainy (June 2014) and dry (April 2014). The locust density was sampled in transect of 100 m(2), as well as the vegetation in 16 m2: plant species richness (PSR) and relative species density (RSD), and analyzed by generalized linear models. Additionally, soil samples were obtained at 10 cm depth into a 4 x 6 m quadrat, land use in the sites was classified and temperature, precipitation and evaporation of each site were obtained from the database and they were analyzed with multiple factor analysis. The population density of S. p. piceifrons was higher in the sites Panaba, Tizimin, Tunkas and Cenotillo (F= 74.3, P < 0.0001). Characterization of vegetation showed that PSR and RSD were higher during the rainy season relative to those in the dry season (F= 50.4, P < 0.0001). RSD was identified as the most important group associated with locust density (0.86), followed by isotherm/isohyets (0.63), maximum precipitation and temperature (0.60), as well as the land use (0.65); no correlation between locust density and soil characteristics was found. Locust density was positively correlated with the abundance of the grass Panicum maximum (Sr-2= 0.85, PC5= 0.87). This work shows that the population of S. p. piceifrons is high in the rainy season and influenced primarily by the abundance of the grass P. maximum and the precipitation.

Here, we performed a life-table study under constant high temperatures and assessed the tolerance of two Bradysia species to heat shock. Life parameters of the Bradysia species indicated slow developmental rates, and low survival rates and fecundity, when the temperature was higher than 30 degrees C.

The model was designed so that it could be used in a later stage to incorporate damage mechanisms of grape diseases, and to analyse their effects on growth and yield over consecutive seasons. The development stage is modelled according to temperature. The within season-dynamics includes (1) the production of assimilates from photosynthesis, (2) the reallocation of assimilates from roots and trunk during the vegetative phase of the crop cycle, (3) the partitioning of assimilates towards leaves, stems, grapes, roots, and trunk, (4) the accumulation of assimilates in roots and trunk after maturity, and (5) leaf senescence. Winter and within-season pruning are also included. The model was parameterised for Vitis labrusca using literature and experimental data. The model was tested with data collected from a 5-year-old vineyard of V. labrusca cv. Niagara Rosada, and evaluated by comparing outputs with data from the literature.

Using time series of timber damage caused by Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) (southern pine beetle) in 10 states within the southern United States, this study examines synchrony in D. frontalis abundance, the synchronizing effects of temperature extremes, and the evidence for shared cycles among state populations. Cross-correlation and cluster analyses are used to quantify synchrony across a range of geographic distances and to identify groups of states with synchronous dynamics. Similar techniques are used to quantify spatial synchrony in temperature extremes and to examine their relationship to D. frontalis fluctuations. Cross-wavelet analysis is then used to examine pairs of time series for shared cycles. These analyses suggest there is substantial synchrony among states in D. frontalis fluctuations, and there are regional groups of states with similar dynamics. Synchrony in D. frontalis fluctuations also appears related to spatial synchrony in summer and winter temperature extremes. The cross-wavelet results suggest that D. frontalis dynamics may differ among regions and are not stationary. Significant oscillations were present in some states over certain time intervals, suggesting an endogenous feedback mechanism. Management of D. frontalis outbreaks could potentially benefit from a multistate regional approach because populations are synchronous on this level.

Development was examined as a function of calendar days as well as degree-days (DD). Results obtained from winter collections revealed that females collected from November to March contained a lower percentage of mature eggs than females collected from April to September. These data suggest that environmental conditions during the dormant period induce reproductive diapause. Oogenesis likely increased with an increase in mean monthly temperatures and DD. The first overwintered females with mature eggs were dissected as early as 21 February 2014 in Trento (7 DD).

J,"Tito, R; Vasconcelos, HL; Feeley, KJ",Global climate change increases risk of crop yield losses and food insecurity in the tropical Andes,"One of the greatest current challenges to human society is ensuring adequate food production and security for a rapidly growing population under changing climatic conditions. Climate change, and specifically rising temperatures, will alter the suitability of areas for specific crops and cultivation systems. In order to maintain yields, farmers may be forced to change cultivation practices, the timing of cultivation, or even the type of crops grown. Alternatively, farmers can change the location where crops are cultivated (e.g., to higher elevations) to track suitable climates (in which case the plants will have to grow in different soils), as cultivated plants will otherwise have to tolerate warmer temperatures and possibly face novel enemies. We simulated these two last possible scenarios (for temperature increases of 1.3 degrees C and 2.6 degrees C) in the Peruvian Andes through a field experiment in which several traditionally grown varieties of potato and maize were planted at different elevations (and thus temperatures) using either the local soil or soil translocated from higher elevations. Maize production declined by 21%-29% in response to new soil conditions. The production of maize and potatoes declined by >87% when plants were grown under warmer temperatures, mainly as a result of the greater incidence of novel pests. Crop quality and value also declined under simulated migration and warming scenarios. We estimated that local farmers may experience severe economic losses of up to 2,300 US$ ha(-1) yr(-1). These findings reveal that climate change is a real and imminent threat to agriculture and that there is a pressing need to develop effective management strategies to reduce yield losses and prevent food insecurity.

The presence and number of AY-phytoplasma in insects and plants were confirmed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) quantification. The number of phytoplasma in leafhoppers increased over time, but did not differ among temperatures. The temperatures associated with a typical crop growing season on the Canadian Prairies will not limit the spread of AY disease by their predominant insect vector. Also, ddPCR quantification is a useful tool for early detection and accurate quantification of phytoplasma in plants and insects.",no,,,,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2045-2322,NA,2018,10.1038/s41598-017-18437-0,WOS:000419668400001

In India, particularly in the state of Kerala, rambutan is mostly confined to two districts, namely Pathanamthitta and Kottayam. Here, rambutan became one of the most treasured fruits, particularly as a courtyard crop or on its fringes in the home garden. Although there are no reports of severe pest and disease attacks in rambutan, several pests are being monitored, which may point to a significant threat in the near future. Two new pests of economic importance (fruit borer: Conogethes punctiferalis and fruit webber: Eublemma anguilifera) have been identified from the rambutan growing tracts of Kerala during last year (2015) from fruit set to fruit ripening stage. Their nature of damage and symptoms of infestation have been clearly studied and being reported for the first time in rambutan. Other pests like mealy bug (Planococcus citri) from fruit set to fruit ripening stage, fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) at fruit ripening stage, and leaf folder (Thalassodes quadraria) damage on young foliages have also been observed. The major disease observed was fruit rot caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.

The aim of this research was to observe their population, infestation rates, and effect on the quality of olive oil. This research included 14 olive groves within 2 different locations. To determine the population dynamics of adult olive fruit flies, 6 yellow sticky traps were placed haphazardly within the tree canopies (approximately 1.5 m in height) of each olive grove between the months of July and December during 2015 and 2016. Results showed that the infestation rate decreases when relative humidity increases (Pearson correlation: -0.597; P = 0.01). On the other hand, negative weak correlation was observed between the altitude and infestation rate (Pearson correlation: -0.206; P = 0.01).

This pest often causes great economic damage due to its high reproductive potential and pesticide resistance. It is well established that temperature is one of the most important factors in determining the survival, development, and size of insects, but the effects can be modified depending on the geographic strains. Here, we investigated the effects of constant temperatures on the survival, development and individual size of Vietnamese H. armigera when reared on bean sprouts in the laboratory. The results showed that the survivals from larval hatching to adult emergence from the pupa were lower under lower temperatures. The duration of the developmental stages decreased as temperature increased from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C. Developmental thresholds for the eggs, larvae, pupae and life cycle were estimated as 11.5, 13.3, 14.4 and 10.2 degrees C, respectively. Thermal constants for the egg, larval and pupal stages were 45.9, 243.9 and 117.6 degree-days above the developmental thresholds, respectively. A thermal constant of 526.3 degree-days above a threshold of 10.2 degrees C was estimated to be required for the life cycle. The size, measured as pupal weight, increased with rearing temperatures. The results of the present study showed that ca. 30 degrees C is the optimal temperature for H. armigena development and growth.

Such data may be important for modelling and forecasting wheat pest attacks. The climatic warming, represented strong environmental factors (R-2 = 0.43), which led to changes in the species structure, favouring the development of the populations of a narrow spectrum of species becoming dominant and dangerous by numerical increases. In the years 2006-2015, the eudominance of thrips (58%), the dominance of aphids (14%) and of wheat flies (12%), the subdominant species of Chrysomelidae and the increase of entomophagus abundance were revealed. In the year 2016, the weight of the dominant groups of wheat flies (25%), aphids (21%), leafhoppers (18%), thrips (17%), of the subdominant group of Chrysomelidae (10.6%) and cereal bugs (4.5%) increased. Changes in entomocenotic interactions phytophagus-entomophagus, changes in pest dynamics, and of optimal moments for treatments important in the development of integrated pest control systems, have occurred in wheat crops. In the conditions of the area, the annual abundance of entomophagus is determined by the annual abundance of phytophagous insects, as expressed by a positive correlation (R-2 = 0.464 and D% = 46.4%). Under the conditions of the last 10 years, the annual ratio of the number of phytophagous / entomophagus fluctuated between 2.35 and 12.42. The size of the phytophagous / entomophagus ratio was strongly correlated with the increase of the average annual temperatures, with a percentage determination coefficient D% = 15.5%, having an optimum of the interactions at values of 6.3 phytophagous / 1 entomophagus, and less well correlated with the annual precipitations. These changes in wheat entomocenoses, the biological potential accumulated over the last 10 years and at the level of 2016 indicate the importance of adapting pest control strategies, which should include preventive methods (respecting the optimum sowing time, agro-technical and phytosanitary methods), insecticide treatments on seed and on vegetation, at optimal application times for the groups of pests whose attacks overlap, respectively the first treatment in the spring, no later than the end of tillering, for wheat flies, leafhoppers, Chrysomelidae etc.; the second treatment at the phenophase of flag leaf stage and ear appearance, for thrips, aphids, bugs etc.; and other treatments at warning.

Using cardboard traps laid every two weeks, we carried out a survey to determine which spider and earwig species are active from September to May in an experimental, pesticide-free, apple orchard under a Mediterranean climate. We observed that spider activity was never completely absent. The structure of the spider communities showed a marked seasonality in three periods (so-called autumn', winter' and spring'). Only two spider genera, Philodromus and Trachelas, were highly active in winter (percentage of catches during this season above 40%) and six others (Lathys, Clubiona, Gnaphosa, Theridion, Phrurolithus) had moderate activity (between 20 and 40%). The two earwig species had different patterns of winter activity with Forficula auricularia almost absent whereas F.pubescens was moderately active on trees. Spider community abundance, diversity and evenness significantly decreased between autumn and winter and remained low in the following spring probably because the attractiveness of the traps is much lower at this time of year due to mild temperatures and the presence of leaves on the trees.

This study is focused on factors that influence the relationship among the thrips, their host plants and abiotic factors. Therefore, the distribution of these thrips species within lotus flowers of different flower ages was assessed using randomly sampling from commercially growing areas in Bangkok, Thailand and investigated thrips abundance on these flowers every week from April to September, 2016. The results revealed that there was a higher thrips population on older lotus flowers. S. dorsalis was much more abundant in summer than in the rainy season. It was found mainly on the pedicel and the outer corolla of the flowers. In the summer and rainy season, F. schultzei occurred most often and were found on the distal parts of lotus petals and pollen areas. Hindu lotus and East Indian lotus could support more of F. schultzei and S. dorsalis than Album Plenum and Roseum Plenum.

Musca domestica was by far the dominant species, comprising 67% of the total flies trapped. Models were developed to assess the relationship between weather parameters and fly abundance and to determine whether population trends could be predicted to improve the timing of control measures. For all three species, there were two main effects, namely time-of-year (mainly reflected by minimum temperatures and solar radiation) and rainfall. The abundance of all three species increased with increasing temperature and rainfall, reaching a peak in summer, before decreasing again. Rainfall events resulted in significantly elevated numbers of M. domestica for up to 5 weeks, and for 1 week for M. vetustissima. Peak fly numbers were predicted by the model to occur in spring and summer, following 85-90-mm weekly rainfall. The population dynamics of S. calcitrans were least influenced by rainfall and it was concluded that weather variables were of limited use for forecasting stable fly numbers in this environment and production system.

Although eradication programs in the United States have reduced the range of this pest, the weevil remains an intractable problem in subtropical Texas, Mexico, and much of South America. A key to managing the weevil in the subtropics and tropics might lie in better understanding its diapause and overwintering survival in regions characterized by relatively high late-season temperatures. We examined the temporal patterns of acquisition of diapause characters at 18.3, 23.9, and 29.4 degrees C, and the effects of temperature during the diapause-induction period on subsequent host-free survival at 23.9 degrees C. Occurrence of the diapause characters generally increased with weevil age at all temperatures but appeared more rapidly at higher temperatures. Acquisition of the diapause characters tended to occur slightly earlier in female weevils compared with the male weevils. Despite the slower development of diapause characters at lower temperatures, when adult weevils were fed under low temperatures, subsequent host-free survival was enhanced. These results are consistent with reports of increased weevil survival with delayed entry into overwintering. Our findings also suggest that the potential host-free survival facilitated by diapause occurring in subtropical or tropical production regions may be reduced compared with dormancy developing in southern temperate regions. This reduced survival potential emphasizes the importance of a maximized host-free season and suggests that the late-season diapause spray intervals should be short enough to ensure that the number of dormant weevils developing in late-season cotton is minimized.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1536-2442,2250-2645,2017,10.1093/jisesa/iex101,WOS:000418913200004

The present study was conducted on six cotton cultivars (3 Bt and 3 non-Bt) to monitor the population dynamics of thrips in relation to abiotic climatic factors. Interaction effect was found significant in Bt varieties but not for non-Bt cultivars. Average thrips population per leaf on various Bt and non-Bt varieties showed that the CIM-557 along with BT-703 had the highest number of thrips density while Bt variety FH-113 had the lowest thrips population per leaf.

The percentage surviving of immature stages were not significantly different at the other six temperatures (range 32.10%-52.72%). The developmental times from egg to adult ranged from 11.68 to 45.13 days and were negatively correlated with temperature. There were significant differences between male and female immature stages in their developmental time at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Regression analysis indicated that both the Lactin and linear models could describe the relationship between developmental rate and temperature for immature stages but a slightly higher coefficient of determination was obtained with the Lactin model. The high-temperature threshold and the optimum temperature for development were 32.04 degrees C and 31.79 degrees C, respectively, estimated by the Lactin model. The low -temperature threshold for development was 11.35 degrees C and thermal constant was 229.76 degree-days for immature stages, estimated by the linear model.

Native to East Asia, this highly polyphagous insect is spreading rapidly worldwide. Climate change will add further complications to managing this species in terms of both geographic distribution and population growth. This study used CLIMEX to compare potential H. halys distribution under recent and future climate models using one emission scenario (A2) with two different global circulation models, CSIRO Mk3.0 and MIROC-H. Simulated changes in seasonal phenology and voltinism were examined. Under the possible future climate scenarios, suitable range in Europe expands northward. In North America, the suitable H. halys range shifts northward into Canada and contracts from its southern temperature range limits in the United States due to increased heat stress. Prolonged periods of warm temperatures resulted in longer H. halys growing seasons. However, future climate scenarios indicated that rising summer temperatures decrease H. halys growth potential compared to recent climatic conditions, which in turn, may reduce mid-summer crop damage. Climate change may increase the number of H. halys generations produced annually, thereby enabling the invasive insect to become multivoltine in the northern latitudes of North America and Europe where it is currently reported to be univoltine. These results indicate prime horticultural production areas in Europe, the northeastern United States, and southeastern Canada are at greatest risk from H. halys under both current and possible future climates.",no,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0046-225X,1938-2936,2017,10.1093/ee/nvx157,WOS:000417734400005

Its invasion into desert agriculture in California and Arizona presents a conundrum between rapid pest development at warm temperatures and severe damage to cool season crops. In this study, the development and survival of B. hilaris were determined at nine constant temperatures (ranging from 20-42 degrees C) when reared on organically grown broccoli florets. Egg hatching was greatly delayed at 20 degrees C, and first instar nymphs did not survive at this temperature. No eggs hatched at 42 degrees C. The highest survival rates (70.0-86.7%) of B. hilaris were observed at temperatures ranging from 24 to 35 degrees C. The total developmental rate of B. hilaris from egg to adult increased from 0.027 to 0.066/d from 24 to 35 degrees C, and then slightly dropped to 0.064/d at 39 degrees C. Based on the linear model, B. hilaris requires 285.4 degree-days to complete its development. The Briere 1 model predicted the lower and upper temperature thresholds as 16.7 and 42.7 degrees C, respectively. The optimal temperature for development (T-Opt) was estimated as 36 degrees C. According to the results, B. hilaris is well adapted to warm conditions, and temperatures of 33-39 degrees C are well suited for B. hilaris development.

We analyzed 17 time-series of the amount of wood damaged by Ips typographus, the most destructive pest of Norway spruce forests, collected across 8 European countries in the last three decades. We aimed to quantify the relative importance of key climate drivers in explaining timber loss dynamics, also testing for possible synergistic effects. Local outbreaks shared the same drivers, including increasing summer rainfall deficit and warm temperatures. Large availability of storm-felled trees in the previous year was also strongly related to an increase in timber loss, likely by providing an alternative source of breeding material. We did not find any positive synergy among outbreak drivers. On the contrary, the occurrence of large storms reduced the positive effect of warming temperatures and rainfall deficit. The large surplus of breeding material likely boosted I. typographus population size above the density threshold required to colonize and kill healthy trees irrespective of other climate triggers. Importantly, we found strong negative density dependence in I. typographus that may provide a mechanism for population decline after population eruptions.

To address these impacts, biological studies on aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover on Bt cotton was conducted for six generations during 2013-14 and 2014-15 under different climate change conditions. The results revealed that the biometry of aphid was influenced by increased carbon dioxide (550 ppm CO2) and temperature (rise in 2 degrees C of the prevailing temperature). This was evidenced by decrease in nymphal developmental time (3.67 +/- 0.21 days), longevity of adult (9.43 +/- 0.41 days), increased fecundity (32.46 +/- 0.95) and reduced life cycle (12.28 +/- 0.23 days) in the elevated conditions (both 550 ppm CO2 with 32 degrees C as well as in 550 ppm CO2 + 34 degrees C). However, morphometry of aphid showed slight variations in all the treatments but, aphids under elevated conditions showed reduced body size which indicated that the fitness of aphid was effected in the enriched carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature conditions.",yes,experimental,laboratory,fecundity,,JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0972-1665,NA,2017,NA,WOS:000418784600004

However, in-formation on its temperature-dependent reproductive behavior and oviposition model is lacking. The longevity and fecundity of P. ringoniella were investigated at seven constant temperatures (13.7, 15.6, 20.5, 23.7, 26.1, 30.2, and 32.3 degrees C), 60-80% RH, and a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h. The longevity and fecundity of P. ringoniella were significantly influenced by temperature. Female adult longevity ranged from 6.3 days at 32.3 degrees C to 18.3 days at 15.6 degrees C. The fecundity ranged from 9.9 eggs at 32.3 degrees C to 65.2 eggs at 15.6 degrees C. The preoviposition (1.5-4.1 days) and oviposition (1.8-12.6 days) periods were significantly affected by temperature, while the postoviposition (1.2-2.2 days) period was not. Female adult aging rates (1/mean longevity) were well described by an inverse second-order polynomial function (r(2) = 0.98), which was used to calculate the physiological ages of female adults. The oviposition model of P. ringoniella comprised four components: adult aging rate model, total fecundity model, age-specific oviposition rate model, and age-specific survival rate model. The relationship between mean total fecundity and temperature was well described by an extreme value function (r(2) = 0.95). Age-specific cumulative oviposition rate was well fitted to a three-parameter Weibull function (r(2) = 0.98) and age-specific survival rate to a sigmoid function (r(2) = 0.99), respectively.

Plant research in northern regions has in recent decades been largely focussed on the opposite trend, namely increasing populations and higher productivity. However, a recent unexpected decline in remotely-sensed estimates of terrestrial Arctic primary productivity suggests that warmer northern lands do not necessarily result in higher productivity. As large-scale plant dieback may become more frequent at high northern latitudes with increasing frequency of extreme events, understanding the drivers of plant dieback is especially urgent. Here, we report on recent extensive damage to dominant, short, perennial heath and tundra plant populations in boreal and Arctic Norway, and assess the potential drivers of this damage. In the High-Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, we recorded that 8-50% of Cassiope tetragona and Dryers octopetala shoots were dead, and that the ratios of dead shoots increased from 2014 to 2015. In boreal Norway, 38-63% of Calluna vulgaris shoots were dead, while Vaccinium myrtillus had damage to 91% of shoots in forested sites, but was healthy in non-forested sites. Analyses of numerous sources of environmental information clearly point towards a winter climate-related reason for damage to three of these four species. In Svalbard, the winters of 2011/12 and 2014/15 were documented to be unusually severe, i.e.insulation from ambient temperature fluctuation by snow was largely absent, and ground-ice enforced additional stress. In boreal Norway, the 2013/14 winter had a long period with very little snow combined with extremely low precipitation rates, something which resulted in frost drought of uncovered Calluna plants. However, extensive outbreaks of a leaf-defoliating geometrid moth were identified as the driver of Vaccinium mortality. These results suggest that weather and biotic extreme events potentially have strong impacts on the vegetation state of northern lands. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Both male and female T. truncatus successfully completed development from egg to adult on the three host plants. The development time from egg to adult for female T. truncatus was longer on Jute than on bean and papaya. Male and female longevities were higher on jute and bean than on papaya. Fecundity of T. truncatus was higher on jute than on bean and papaya. Adult pre-oviposition period was lower on bean and the number of oviposition days were higher on jute. The net reproduction rate of T. truncatus was significantly higher on jute than on bean and papaya, whereas intrinsic rate of natural increase and the finite rate of increase were higher on bean than on the other two host plants.

Earlier work on this pest has shown that degree day models can be used to predict H. marginata emergence based on soil temperatures. Here, we. show how the availability of regular long-term trapping data can be used to update and improve upon this earlier model by predicting the progression of emergence. The emergence of adult H. marginata at three sites in the UK was monitored over two flight seasons using pheromone traps. The data confirmed the presence of multiple peaks in emergence over several weeks. Rainfall events followed by an accumulation of 512DD (+/- 9.11DD) above 0 degrees C could be used to predict peaks with greater accuracy than degree day accumulations alone. Cumulative percentage emergence as a function of degree day accumulations was best described by a probit model. The probit model predicted H. marginata emergence at other sites and years to within 4 days. Application of these models will enable growers to forecast peaks in emergence, make informed assessments of crop risk and time application of chemical controls appropriately and only where required.

Thermal tolerance, including the functional activity limits of critical thermal maxima and minima (CTmax and CTmin respectively), upper and lower lethal temperature, and the effect of heat and cold hardening (short-term acute plasticity), is measured across a diverse range of low or high temperature stress conditions in both larvae and adults. We also report the sum of inducible and cognate forms of the amounts of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) as an explanatory variable for changes in thermotolerance. The results show that the larvae have high variability in CTmax and CTmin at different ramping rates and low levels of basal (innate) thermal tolerance. By contrast, the adults show high basal tolerance and overall lower variability in CTmax and CTmin, indicating lower levels of phenotypic plasticity in thermotolerance. HSP70 responses, although variable, do not reflect these tolerance or survival patterns. Larvae survive across a broader range of temperatures, whereas adults remain active across a broader range of temperatures. Life stage-related variation in thermal tolerance is most pronounced under the slowest (most ecologically-relevant) ramping rate (0.06 degrees C min(-1)) during lower critical thermal limit experiments and least pronounced during upper thermal limit experiments. Thus, the ramping rate can hinder or enhance the detection of stage-related variation in thermal limits to activity and survival of insects.",no,,,,,PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0307-6962,1365-3032,2017,10.1111/phen.12210,WOS:000414567800010

Yet considering regional variation in response to climate is necessary to better predict the consequences of climate change on pest population dynamics and associated damage. We investigated the climatic drivers of demographic fluctuations in a forest tree defoliator, the pine pro cessionary moth (PPM), in 8 biogeographical regions in France. We studied the effects of precipitation and temperature for both cold and warm periods, in accordance with PPM biology. We trained second-order log linear models of infestation dynamics based on records spanning over 32 years (1981-2014) and 1239 forest plots, and tested their forecast accuracy on two additional years (2013-2014). PPM population growth rate decreased with higher precipitations in 5 regions and increased with increasing temperatures in the cold period in 4 regions. The magnitude and direction of temperature effects in the warm period varied among biogeographical regions. Our results also revealed that PPM population dynamics were largely triggered by density-dependent factors independent from climatic drivers. Short-term forecasts were generally accurate irrespective of the inclusion of climatic variables into the models. To better predict the consequences of climate change on insect population dynamics, it is advisable to take geographical variability of species response into account and develop regional forecasting models.",yes,field,abundance,,,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0378-1127,1872-7042,2017,10.1016/j.foreco.2017.08.024,WOS:000413384000014

J,"Zerulla, FN; Augel, C; Zebitz, CPW",Oviposition activity of Drosophila suzukii as mediated by ambient and fruit temperature,"The invasive pest Drosophila suzukii was introduced to southern Europe in 2008 and spread throughout Central Europe in the following years. Precise reliable data on the temperature-dependent behavior of D. suzukii are scarce but will help forecasting and cultivation techniques. Depending on physico-chemical properties, surface temperature of objects may differ from ambient temperatures, determining physical activity, and affect oviposition on or into substrate, determining preimaginal development later. Therefore, the preferred ambient temperatures of D. suzukii and fruit temperature for oviposition were examined on a linear temperature gradient device. Thirty adults (15 female; 15 male) were adapted to different temperatures (10, 20, 30 degrees C) for six days and then exposed to different temperature gradients (10-25, 20-35, 25-40 degrees C). D. suzukii adapted to 10 degrees C remained in cooler regions and suffered from a significantly higher mortality at the 25-40 degrees C gradient. Animals adapted to warmer temperatures had a wider temperature preference on the gradient device. Acclimation to lower temperatures and the resulting lower temperature preferences may allow the flies to disperse better in spring to search for oviposition sites. The oviposition activity decreased continuously at a fruit temperature above 28 degrees C and below 15 degrees C, with highest oviposition activity in fruits with temperatures between 19.7 degrees C and 24.8 degrees C.

There is limited information on this pest's ecology to facilitate the management strategies, and thus a study on its ecology was conducted at five sites in South Africa for two years. We monitored A. modicella flight activity using pheromone traps and larval infestation on various commercial (groundnut, soya bean (Glycine maxima L.), lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.)) and wild hosts in order to understand its dispersal and the role of alternative hosts in the carryover of A. modicella populations from one season to another.

J,"Shi, PJ; Fan, ML; Reddy, GVP",Comparison of Thermal Performance Equations in Describing Temperature-Dependent Developmental Rates of Insects: (III) Phenological Applications,"The developmental times of poikilotherms at different stages are significantly affected by temperature. Most mathematical models describing the temperature-dependent developmental rates of poikilotherms are built according to the experimental data at various constant temperatures. However, these models can also be applied to the developmental rates at variable temperatures. It is more meaningful to use models to predict the occurrence times of pest insects that actually represent the completion for a particular developmental stage (e.g., hatching, pupation, eclosion) under a natural thermal environment. For some developmental stages, insects might experience a period of high temperatures. In this case, skewed bell-shaped nonlinear models are more reasonable than the linear and exponential models because in the high-temperature region the developmental rate decreases with temperature increasing. We used the accumulated developmental progress method that combines three representative nonlinear models to compare the model validity in predicting the egg's earliest hatching date of bamboo locust in different years. We found that for the springtime phenological event the simple Arrhenius' equation obtains the best goodness of fit. This study also provides a general R function that permits users to employ nonlinear parametric models to predict the occurrence times of insect phenology. In fact, if the investigation data cannot reflect the temperature-based phenological models proposed here, we have to consider whether the data set is reliable or whether the temperature is the crucial factor that determines the occurrence time of interest. The present study is valuable for the integrated management of pest insects because the biological or chemical control timing relies on the prediction on the occurrence time of phenological events.",no,,,,,ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0013-8746,1938-2901,2017,10.1093/aesa/sax063,WOS:000414410300007

Implications of climate change on their future pest status have not been fully considered. Here, we report growth of female G.pallida and G.rostochiensis over the range 15 to 25 degrees C. Females per plant and their fecundity declined progressively with temperatures above 17.5 degrees C for G.pallida, whilst females per plant were optimal between 17.5 and 22.5 degrees C for G.rostochiensis. Relative reproductive success with temperature was confirmed on two potato cultivars infected with either species at 15, 22.5 and 25 degrees C. The reduced reproductive success of G.pallida at 22.5 degrees C relative to 15 degrees C was also recorded for a further seven host cultivars studied. The differences in optimal temperatures for reproductive success may relate to known differences in the altitude of their regions of origin in the Andes. Exposure of G.pallida to a diurnal temperature stress for one week during female growth significantly suppressed subsequent growth for one week at 17.5 degrees C but had no effect on G.rostochiensis. However, after two weeks of recovery, female size was not significantly different from that for the control treatment. Future soil temperatures were simulated for medium- and high-emission scenarios and combined with nematode growth data to project future implications of climate change for the two species. Increased soil temperatures associated with climate change may reduce the pest status of G.pallida but benefit G.rostochiensis especially in the southern United Kingdom.

It is univoltine, but some individuals exhibit prolonged diapause. In this study, we documented diapause termination rate of cocooned larvae at different diapausing periods and time required for adult emergence when they were brought to 25 degrees C from the field in northern China. We found that field larvae all entered diapause by June, but none terminated diapause until late September when the daily average temperature dropped to below 20 degrees C. Furthermore, termination rate increased significantly as diapausing larvae underwent increasing chilling duration, reaching > 95% from early December to early March. Our results suggest that chilling was necessary for diapause to terminate and that field diapause termination ended in early December. To explore low temperature and duration required, we cold-treated field diapausing larvae of different periods at different low temperatures for various lengths of time prior to the 25 degrees C incubation. Chilling at 4-8 degrees C for 60-90 days resulted in a higher termination rate ( > 90%) and shorter adult emergence time in general. Additionally, we investigated the combined effect of temperature (18-30 degrees C) and soil moisture (20-60%, on dry weight basis) as well as the effect of photoperiod (24:0-0:24 L:D) on post-diapause development. While photoperiod did not affect adult emergence, soil moisture ranging from 30 to 50% and temperature from 22 to 26 degrees C resulted in the highest adult emergence rates ( > 46%) within relatively short time ( < 18 days). Mortality and/or prolonged diapause rate drastically increased when incubation conditions were outside the optimal range, especially at 30 degrees C.

The current study sets the differences in the feeding behavior of neonate Alabama argillacea (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae exposed to Bt and non-Bt cotton plants, under different temperatures and time gap after hatching. Two cotton cultivars were used: the Bt (DP 404 BG - bollgard) and the non-transformed isoline, DP 4049. We found that the feeding behavior of neonate A. argillacea is significantly different between Bt and non-Bt cotton. Based on the number of larvae with vegetal tissue in their gut found on the plant and in the organza as well as on the amount of vegetal tissue ingested by the larvae. A. argillacea shows feeding preference for non-Bt cotton plants, in comparison to that on the Bt. However, factors such as temperature and exposure time may affect detection capacity and plant abandonment by the larvae and it results in lower ingestion of vegetal tissue. Such results are relevant to handle the resistance of Bt cotton cultivars to A. argillacea and they also enable determining how the cotton seeds mix will be a feasible handling option to hold back resistance evolution in A. argillacea populations on Bt cotton, when it is compared to other refuge strategies.

India is the second largest cultivator of mustard followed by China. The oilseed production increased significantly after yellow revolution but increasing population made pressure on production. The major losses in mustard yield occurs due to the attack of different pest and diseases. An option to minimize the losses in production of oilseed Brassica can be the suppression of the pest and disease incidence through modification of microclimate by altering the crop row direction. This experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of microclimate variability due to different crop row directions on pest and disease incidence. The pest and disease are highly sensitive to temperature and relative humidity (RH) within crop canopy environment.

Heat stress negatively affected fecundity but increased adult heat resistance and adult longevity. Fitness effects were mostly consistent across populations but there were also some population differences. In the Shenyang population from northern China, there was a hormetic effect of heat on female longevity not evident in the other populations.

Besides direct damage caused to fruits, A. grandis occurrence in producing regions can lead to export embargos. Despite its economic importance, little is known of the effects of temperature on its biology. This study investigated the development of A. grandis under different temperatures to estimate thermal requirements and then validated the model developed in the field. Development time was inversely proportional to temperature and greater fecundity and fertility were observed at 25 degrees C. Greater egg and pupa viabilities as well as a greater number of insects per fruit were also observed at 25 degrees C. The thermal threshold and the thermal constant for egg and pupal stages were 8.3 C for both stages and 132.3 degree-days (DD) for the egg stage and 347.0 DD for the pupal stage. For the egg-to-adult period the values were 5.2 degrees C and 858.7 DD. Data collected in the field showed DD (937.9) and duration (79.7 d) values of the egg-to-adult period similar to those estimated in the laboratory. This information could support management of A. grandis, since the model for temperature requirements can be used to predict pest occurrence in crops and estimate the number of generations per year.

A five-stage ranking system based on ovary development was able to distinguish between the reproductive statuses of field-collected females.

Results identify that H.halys enters reproductive diapause in temperate locations in the fall and that a delay occurs in developmental maturity after diapause termination in the spring. Modification of the Snyder method to identify biofix determined 12.7-hr photoperiod as the best fit to define initiation of reproduction in the spring. Applying the biofix, we demonstrated significant differences between locations for the rate at which the overwintering generation transition into reproductive status and the factors contributing to this difference require further study. For example, after including abiotic variables influencing development such as temperature and photoperiod (critical diapause cue), reproduction occurred earlier in OR and for an extended period in NJ.

It is far less invasive than two congeneric species from the same area, I. glandulifera and I. parviflora. The factors responsible for its limited success are poorly known, though they may be related to low frost tolerance and low popularity as an ornamental plant. Maladaptive habitat preferences, a factor not studied to date, may also play an important role. The aim of this study was to determine those responsible factors and to examine the consequences of habitat selection by I. balfourii on the Swiss-Italian border, where the species is assumed to be invasive. After exhaustive mapping of its distribution and measurement of the plants' performance parameters, we checked for signs of disease and pest attack on individual plants growing in different habitats, and analysed the local abiotic characteristics. The distribution pattern differed significantly between the two studied countries. There were four times as many Italian localities of I. balfourii and they were clearly concentrated along roadsides, whereas the few Swiss localities were scattered among other habitats. The level of leaf damage along roadsides was lower, suggesting higher release from natural enemies there, which, however, did not translate into investment in plant size or fecundity. Patch area along roadsides correlated positively with the presence of buildings and shading; the plant's ability to spread decreased with elevation. These results confirm that invasion by this shade-tolerant species is driven by propagule pressure and that its dispersal ability is low; that may change with climate warming. Although roads provide suitable conditions and invasion corridors, and despite possibly higher propagule pressure on the Swiss side, in Switzerland the preference for this habitat is maladaptive for I. balfourii, due to intensive mowing, which seems to create an ecological trap.

Forest managers could use early warning of where and how much tree mortality to expect in the very near future to plan and prioritize hazard tree removal, pest suppression activities, infer location of funding needs and fuels reduction treatments as well as access for firefighting. To answer these needs, we developed an empirically-based forecast model for expected tree mortality for an upcoming year based on (1) previous years' tree mortality as observed in late summer; (2) previous years' hydrologic year precipitation levels; and (3) site characteristics including amount of available host. Using this approach, initial forecasts for the next growing season can be developed by late fall for the following late summer. We demonstrated the application of this model by developing a forecast for the state of California for 2017. The explanatory variables in the California model accounted for similar to 43% of the variability in tree mortality. Overall, the model missed forecasting high levels of mortality in approximately 5% of forested or woodland locations for the state of California. Locations with more mortality than expected in 2015 & 2016 were mostly associated with new outbreaks of insects; land use changes, and margins of prescribed- or wildfires not initially attributed.

The magnitudes of these effects are contingent on predator and prey traits that may change with environmental conditions. Aberrant thermal regimes could disrupt pest suppression through asymmetric effects, e.g. heat-sensitive predator vs. heat-tolerant prey. To explore potential effects of warming on suppressing pests and controlling herbivory in a vegetable crop, we performed laboratory experiments exposing an important pest species to two spider predator species at different temperatures. Heat tolerance was characterised by the critical thermal maxima parameter (CTM50) of the cucumber beetle (Diabrotica undecimpunctata), wolf spider (Tigrosa helluo), and nursery web spider (Pisaurina mira). Cucumber beetles and wolf spiders were equally heat tolerant (CTM50 > 40 degrees C), but nursery web spiders had limited heat tolerance (CTM50 = 34 degrees C). Inside mesocosms, beetle feeding increased with temperature, wolf spiders were always effective predators, nursery web spiders were less lethal at high temperature (38 degrees C). Neither spider species reduced herbivory at ambient temperature (22 degrees C), however, at warm temperature both species reduced herbivory with evidence of a dominant non-consumptive effect.

Although Asian gypsy moth has similar morphology to that of European and North American gypsy moth, it has several traits that make it a greater threat, the most important being the flight capability of females. Asian gypsy moth is not yet established in North America; however, infestations have been detected multiple times in Canada and the United States. To facilitate detection and eradication efforts, we evaluated the effect of a range of temperatures on development time, survivorship, and fertility of eight populations of Asian gypsy moth. There were significant impacts of temperature and population on these life history characteristics. The larval developmental rate increased with temperature until it reached an optimum at 29 degrees C. Larvae experienced significant molting problems at the highest and lowest temperatures tested (10 degrees C and 30 degrees C). At 30 degrees C, female fitness was markedly compromised, as evidenced by reduced fecundity and fertility. This suggests that development and survival of Asian gypsy moth may be limited by summer temperature extremes in the Southern United States. We also determined the degree-day requirements for two critical life stages and two populations of Asian gypsy moth, which represent the extremes in latitude, to predict the timing for biopesticide application and adult trap deployment.

Historical records of alates collected in the area showed that the two species have distinct peaks of flight activity, from mid-February to late April for C. gestroi, and from early April to late June for C. formosanus. However, an overlap of the two dispersal flight seasons has been observed since at least 2005. The daily monitoring of dispersal flight events in southeastern Florida in 2014, 2015, and 2016 confirmed that simultaneous flights occurred several times each year. In addition, environmental conditions for favorable flights were identified, and it was established that low temperature was the primary factor inhibiting both species from dispersal flights, while all other factors had little impact on the occurrence of major dispersal flight events. However, both species shared similar temperature requirements for favorable dispersal flight conditions despite distinct peaks of activity over time.

Thus, aphid population data were compiled and subjected to spatial and temporal distribution analysis. Weather data, obtained from an established network of weather stations located in the monitoring areas, were used in a nonparametric multiplicative regression analysis to determine which abiotic variables may impact aphid populations. Weather conditions were characterized using confidence intervals (CIs) established based on weather data from 1999 to 2005 for each environmental variable.

The rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee, is a serious insect pest of rice fields in summer. Population outbreaks have become more frequent in the last ten years. In addition to adult migration, rice leaf folders are thought to have other thermal adaptations. Therefore, the behaviours of larval and adult rice leaf folders, such as leaf folding (making shelter) and habitat selection for pupae and eggs, were observed on rice plants under heat stress. The results showed that larval shelter-making velocities significantly decreased during or after four hours of heat exposure, and shelter size decreased as the temperature increased. Larvae preferred to pupate on young rice leaves at 27 degrees C and middle-aged leaves at 30 degrees C, but they strongly preferred older leaves when reared at 34 degrees C. Female moths generally preferred to oviposit on the top of young leaves, but they preferred the middle and lower leaves for egg deposition when exposed to 36 and 40 degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, more eggs were distributed on the lower surfaces of rice leaves with an increase in heat stress.

This situation has prompted a demand for alternative pest management strategies aiming to control T. absoluta and concomitantly reduce insecticide applications. The development period for immature stages of T. absoluta at constant temperatures was modelled to select appropriatemathematical functions for simulating its development. RESULTS: The performance of themodels varied according to the insect development stage, but in general all models performed well considering the statistical criteria used. Discrimination among models was possible only when the reliability of the temperature thresholds estimated by the models was used as an additional criterion. In this case, the models Briere-1, Lactin-2 and Shi proved adequate to describe the relationship between temperature and development rate of T. absoluta.

We developed a phenology model with the aims of replacing this costly labour practice and by considering the Swiss landscape. Observations collected over 29years were used for model calibration and validation. We parameterized a time-varying distributed delay model based on published laboratory observations of development durations at constant temperatures. The model was driven with hourly temperature recordings beginning on January 1. The calibration of the mean development rates and their variations was based on semi-field data of larval and pupal development. The model, with its calibrated parameters and their variations, allowed the simulation of mean predictions and prediction intervals. We validated the model predictions of emergence with flight data (obtained via light traps) from several sites in western and northern Switzerland. The simulated mean emergence was 6.9 degree-days earlier than the observed flight at the calibration sites and only 0.5 degree-days earlier than the observed flight at other sites. Our simulation of pupation explained half of the variation in emergence time, whereas semi-field observations of pupation explained three-quarters of this variation. Our model simulations are not subjected to the local potential biases. Simulation errors from a year with an extremely dry spring were explained by the lack of consideration of humidity by the model. Our simulations provide a valid and less labour-intensive alternative to observations for timing biological control in the maize-growing areas of Switzerland and likely other areas of Europe.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0931-2048,1439-0418,2017,10.1111/jen.12364,WOS:000402677200001

Previous research suggests that R. indifferens is unlikely to establish in commercial cherry production areas in California and in tropical export markets because cold temperatures, below 5 degrees C, in those regions appear insufficient to complete diapause. However, it is unclear how prolonged absence of cold exposure affects diapause termination in R. indifferens. Here, we examined this question by exposing R. indifferens pupae for 40 wk to simulated temperate and tropical conditions of 23 or 26 degrees C, 40 or 80% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 or 12:12 (L:D) h. Eclosion patterns among fly groups in the four conditions did not differ. For all groups, fly eclosion from pupae not exposed to cold exhibited a bimodal distribution. The first major peak, comprising 3.2% of the total fly emergence, occurred at 1-10 wk. The second major peak, comprising the remaining 96.8%, occurred at a mode of similar to 30 wk. Based on responses to no cold and cold (3 +/- 1.5 degrees C) exposures, there were three distinct pupal diapause groups: the first eclosion group was likely nondiapausing pupae; the second eclosion group was likely diapausing pupae; a third group that remained viable but did not produce adults after 40 wk may represent prolonged dormancy pupae.

To establish a temperature-dependent phenology model, essential for understanding the development and growth of the pest population under a variety of climates and as part of a pest risk analysis, L. huidobrensis life-table data were collected under laboratory conditions at seven constant temperatures on its host faba bean (Vicia faba L.). Several nonlinear equations were fitted to each life stage to model the temperature-dependent population growth and species life history and finally compile an overall temperature-dependent pest phenology model using the Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software. Liriomyza huidobrensis completed development from egg to adult in all temperatures evaluated, except at 32 degrees C, which was lethal to pupae. Eggs did not develop at 35 degrees C. Mean development time of all immature stages decreased with increasing temperature. Nonlinear models predicted optimal temperature for immature survival between 20-25 degrees C (32-38% mortality of all immature stages). Life-table parameters simulated at constant temperatures indicated that L. huidobrensis develops within the range of 12-28 degrees C. Simulated life-table for predicting the population dynamics of L. huidobrensis under two contrasting environments showed that lowland temperatures at the coast of Peru (250 m.a.s.l.) presented better conditions for a potential population increase than highland (3,400 m.a.s.l.) conditions.

We measured the main developmental parameters of three typical defoliating insects (i.e., Ourapteryx ebuleata szechuana, Biston marginata, and Euproctis angulata) and their preferences for five host plants at temperatures from 16A degrees C to 31A degrees C at 3A degrees C intervals in the Tiantong National Forest Research station in eastern China. The results showed the following. 1) An appropriate rise in temperature increases the survival rate with an increase in the number of offspring. The developmental durations for these three insects were shortened, and pupal weight increased with an increase in temperature. 2) A shift in the preference for host plants for these three insects was observedat elevated temperatures. They all preferred to feed on Schima superba and Castanopsis sclerophylla at elevated temperatures, showing an opposite response to the other three plants. The daily leaf consumption of the three insects was positively correlated with their feeding preference, with more leaves being consumed from the plants they preferred. 3) For O. ebuleata szechuana larvae, daily leaf consumption initially increased and then decreased with increasing temperatures. In contrast, Biston marginata and Euproctis angulata larvae consumed more leaves at elevated temperatures. The feeding preferences of O. ebuleata szechuana and Biston marginata were more sensitive to changing temperatures than that of Euproctis angulata laevae. We concluded that increased numbers of offspring and generations, pupal weights, and a shift in preference to two plants for these three defoliating insects might lead to severe damage to these two plants which would enhance the fragmentation and decrease the stability of the forest communities under changing temperatures. Meanwhile, the variations in the responses of defoliating insects to the changing temperatures should be taken into consideration for the pest management of forests to adapt to the changing climate.",yes,experimental,laboratory,consumption,,FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2095-0195,2095-0209,2017,10.1007/s11707-016-0582-3,WOS:000402454100010

Field experiments were carried out over two planting times to evaluate the use of sticky traps for monitoring thrips infesting tomato in East Africa. Blue, yellow, and clear sticky traps with and without a thrips lure (Lurem-TR) were tested. Field observations for thrips catches on the sticky traps were made weekly until crop senescence. Sticky traps were replaced with new ones at each observation time. Additionally, both destructive and non-destructive samplings for thrips were done at each observation. Frankliniella schultzei (Trybom) and Ceratothripoides brunneus (Bagnall) were more attracted to blue than yellow traps. Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) attraction to blue and yellow traps was not distinctive. The addition of Lurem-TR on traps increased captures of F. schultzei and F. occidentalis but not of C. brunneus. Blue traps with Lurem-TR captures had the highest correlation with absolute estimate of thrips density on the plants.

This study was conducted to investigate the stage-specific development and survival of H. halys immatures by combining the results of previous studies and this study. An adult development rate model and three major oviposition component models of H. halys were also developed. Development rates were fitted with a nonlinear Briere model, which estimated optimal temperatures as 32.0 and 30.8 degrees C, lower development thresholds as 10.0 and 13.1 degrees C, and upper development thresholds as 33.6 and 33.5 degrees C for egg and nymph, respectively. In a linear model, the lower development thresholds were 12.5 and. 12.8 degrees C for egg and nymph, respectively.

Organisms experiencing temperatures above their optimum on a thermal performance curve exhibit rapid declines in function and these supraoptimal temperatures can be a critical physiological component of range limits. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is one of the best-documented biological invasions and factors driving its spatial spread are of significant ecological and economic interest. The present study examines gypsy moth sourced from different latitudes across its North American range for sensitivity to high temperature in constant temperature growth chamber experiments. Supraoptimal temperatures result in higher mortality in northern populations compared with populations from the southern range extent (West Virginia and coastal plain of Virginia, U.S.A.). Sublethal effects of high temperature on traits associated with fitness, such as smaller pupal mass, are apparent in northern and West Virginia populations. Overall, the results indicate that populations near the southern limits of the range are less sensitive to high temperatures than northern populations from the established range. However, southern populations are lower performing overall, based on pupal mass and development time, relative to northern populations. This suggests that there may be a trade-off associated with decreased heat sensitivity in gypsy moth. Understanding how species adapt to thermal limits and possible fitness trade-offs of heat tolerance represents an important step toward predicting climatically driven changes in species ranges, which is a particularly critical consideration in conservation and invasion ecology.",no,,,,,PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0307-6962,1365-3032,2017,10.1111/phen.12190,WOS:000400032000009

Predicting RPH population dynamics and identifying their source areas are crucial for the management of these migratory pests in China, but the origins of the migrants to temperate and subtropical regions in China remains unclear. In particular, their early migration to China in March and April have not yet been explored due to a lack of research data available from potential source areas, Central Vietnam and Laos. In this study, we examined the population dynamics and migratory paths of N. lugens and S. furcifera in Vietnam and South China in 2012 and 2013. Trajectory modeling showed that in March and April in 2012 and 2013, RPH emigrated from source areas in Central Vietnam where rice was maturing to the Red River Delta and South China. Early migrants originated from Southern Central Vietnam (14-16 degrees N), but later most were from Northern Central Vietnam (16-19 degrees N). Analysis of meteorological and light-trap data from Hepu in April (1977-2013) using generalized linear models showed that immigration increased with precipitation in Southern Central Vietnam in January, but declined with precipitation in Northern Central Vietnam in January. These results determined that the RPH originate from overwintering areas in Central Vietnam, but not from southernmost areas of Vietnam. Winter precipitation, rather than temperature was the most important factor determining the number of RPH migrants. Based on their similar population dynamics and low population densities in Central Vietnam, we further speculated that RPH migrate to track ephemeral food resources whilst simultaneously avoiding predators. Migrations do not seem to be initiated by interspecific competition, overcrowding or host deterioration. Nevertheless, S. furcifera establishes populations earlier than N. lugens South China, perhaps to compensate for interspecific competition.

The cross-correlation (Spearman (R)) between defoliation indicators and temperature was positive and relatively constant over time for all broadleaves and conifers, combined and separately, except for Fagus sylvatica (European beech), which had a negative cross-correlation coefficient. The correlation obtained for precipitation was similar to that obtained for temperature; however, this relationship was negative (except, again, for beech). The temporal influence of temperature on defoliation was much lower than that of precipitation, which had the greatest influence in dry regions (south and southeast Romania), especially for Quercus species. Furthermore, precipitation had a positive influence in moderate climate regions for conifers that were situated outside their natural distribution ranges.

A better understanding of the reproductive cycle over the year can lead to testing new strategies in preventive adult treatment scheduling, thus reducing the populations in the following summer when fruits are set. Adult flights of overwintering populations of B. oleae have been described for two areas of Tuscany. A degree day model for the overwintering population of B. oleae was applied to adult emergence in spring. We monitored the reproductive cycle of this pest during two years. Insect morphology and oviposition activity of B. oleae females caught by traps in the two sampling areas in the spring were studied by dissecting and observing the whole mount reproductive apparatus under a stereomicroscope. The observation of ovaries containing follicular relics and the presence of sperm cells in most ovipositing females validated the occurrence of egg fertilization and, therefore, the presence of a complete generation in the spring. The tested degree-day phenological model for adult emergence from autumn oviposition was proved useful in studying the population dynamics of B. oleae. The 50% of cumulative captures (male plus female) was reached in the first half of April, with few days of difference between years and sites.

The projected increase in winter temperatures under climate change could affect overwinter survival, timing of spring emergence and, ultimately, the severity of this pest. 2 We assessed the potential effects of warmer winters in field experiments performed in three consecutive years. Three warming levels were applied: (i) heated approximately 4 degrees C above ambient; (ii) unheated with snow cover left intact; and (iii) unheated with snow cover removed. Survival and date of emergence were assessed in all years, and beetle lipid content was analyzed in 1 year to determine rates of energy use. 3 Overwinter survival was 6.5-14.5% among years. Winter warming inconsistently affected overwinter survival: increasing survival in one winter, decreasing survival in the warmest winter and having no effect in one winter. Beetles that received supplemental winter warming emerged approximately 2 weeks earlier in spring, and lipid content did not differ among treatment groups. 4 Earlier spring emergence may allow for the production of an additional generation per year of C. trifurcata under future climate change. However, further experiments are required to establish the relationship between overwinter survival and subsequent beetle population growth to determine potential pest status and best management practices under future climate conditions.",no,,,,,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1461-9555,1461-9563,2017,10.1111/afe.12196,WOS:000403024600007

Latitude and row orientation both had a significant effect on psyllid density during winter. Diaphorina citri abundance was higher when more than 20% of the surrounding landscape was urbanized. 5 These findings suggest that only conventional management of groves reduced D. citri populations during winter periods. By contrast, intermittent management was associated with higher D. citri populations.

The mean developmental time of one generation was about 120, 64 and 37days at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. The egg stage comprised about 9% of the total development or about 16% of the pre-imaginal development. The larval stages took about 39% of the entire and about 66% of the pre-imaginal development. The pupal stage needed about 11% of the total or about 18% of the pre-imaginal development. The lower developmental threshold for one generation was 11.2 degrees C. The egg stage had the highest lower developmental threshold of 12.0 degrees C, the pupa the lowest of 9.8 degrees C and the total larval stages showed a value of 11.2 degrees C.

J,"Moradi-Vajargah, M; Parry, HR","Environmental and biological drivers of flight initiation in a sporadic pest, Rutherglen bug, Nysius vinitor Bergroth (Hemiptera: Orsillidae)","Flight initiation is fundamental to insect dispersal. Insights into the meteorological and environmental drivers of flight initiation, and their relative importance, can therefore help determine the conditions under which mass dispersal events may occur. In relation to insect pestmanagement, the ability to anticipate such events would allow us to predict mass colonisation of crops and better manage outbreaks of an insect pest. This study insects aims to better predict flight initiation of Rutherglen bug, Nysius vinitor, and thus crop outbreaks originating from over-winter weed hosts. We examined the influence of temperature in combination with sex and the availability of food and water, under controlled environment conditions inside a flight chamber. Most of the variation in flight initiation was explained by temperature. We found that warm temperatures are required for flight initiation: the lower flight threshold was determined as 21 degrees C, the optimum temperature for flight as 25 degrees C and the upper flight threshold as 28 degrees C, fitting a quadratic distribution. However, additional data shows that such thresholds are not limiting: when N. vinitor is under extreme heat stress (35-40 degrees C) for a short period, they have a very high propensity to take-off. The rate of flight initiation was fastest within the first 5 h in both males and females for all tested temperatures. A lack of food and water resulted in a faster take-off rate of males, but had no effect on female flight initiation. Application of our analysis to temperature data in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld), Australia, indicates that flight initiation in N. vinitor is likely to be highly seasonal, with very little flight activity expected in winter in eastern Australia. We found a longer suitable flight period and a greater number of suitable flight days per month in Qld compared to NSW.

Understanding the population dynamics of mirids is key to their management; however, the current recommended hand-height assessment method is labour intensive. The objective of the study was to compare recently developed mirid sex pheromone trapping and visual hand-height assessment methods as monitoring tools on cocoa farms and to consider implications for a decision support system. Ten farms from the Eastern and Ashanti regions of Ghana were used for the study. Mirid numbers and damage were assessed fortnightly on twenty trees per farm, using both methods, from January 2012 to April 2013. The mirid population increased rapidly in June, reached a peak in September and began to decline in October. There was a significant linear relationship between numbers of mirids sampled to hand-height and mirid damage. High numbers of male mirids were recorded in pheromone traps between January and April 2012 after which there was a gradual decline. There was a significant inverse relationship between numbers of trapped adult mirids and mirids sampled to hand-height (predominantly nymphs). Higher temperatures and lower relative humidities in the first half of the year were associated with fewer mirids at hand-height, but larger numbers of adult males were caught in pheromone traps. The study showed that relying solely on one method is not sufficient to provide accurate information on mirid population dynamics and a combination of the two methods is necessary.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0931-2048,1439-0418,2017,10.1111/jen.12332,WOS:000399606800002

To test if there is a low level of ontogenetic variation for heat responses in one such species, the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae, basal tolerance [upper lethal temperature (ULT50) and maximum critical temperature (CTmax)], hardening capacity (CTmax) and hardening costs (adult longevity and fecundity) were measured across five stages (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th-instar nymphs and newly moulted adults). We found large tolerance differences among stages of this global pest species, and a tendency for the stage with lower heat tolerance to show a stronger hardening response. there were also substantial reproductive costs of hardening responses, with the level of stress experienced, and not the proximity of the exposed stage to the reproductive adult stage, influencing the magnitude of this cost. Hence hardening in this aphid may counter inherently low tolerance levels of some life stages but at a cost to adult longevity and fecundity.

However, it remains unclear how warming will affect herbivore population size and population composition, consequently altering herbivore colonization in a tri-trophic system (plant-herbivore-predator or crop-pest-biocontrol agent). We studied a soybean-aphid-lady beetle system, by conducting (1) a laboratory warming experiment to examine warming impact (+2 degrees C or +4 degrees C) on the aphid population size and composition (alate proportion), and (2) a field colonization experiment to examine whether the warming-induced effect subsequently interacts with predators (lady beetles) in affecting aphid colonization. The results showed that warming affected the initial aphid population composition (reduced alate proportion) but not population size; this warming-induced effect strengthened the top-down control by lady beetles and slowing aphid colonization. In other words, biocontrol on crop pests by predators could improve under 2-4 degrees C warming. Furthermore, aphid colonization was affected by an interaction between the alate proportion and predator (lady beetle) presence. This study suggests that warming affects herbivore population composition and likely mediates top-down control on herbivore colonization by predators. This mechanism may be crucial but underappreciated in climate change ecology because population composition (wing form, sex ratio, age/body size structure) shifts in many species under environmental change.",yes,experimental,greenhouse,abundance,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2045-2322,NA,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-01155-y,WOS:000399535300002

We parameterized a temperature-driven D. suzukii population dynamics model using temperature data derived from several Global Circulation Models (CMIP5) with a range of relative concentration pathway (RCP) predictions. Mean consensus between the models suggest that without adaptation to both higher prolonged temperatures and higher short-term temperature events D. suzukii population levels are likely to drop in currently higher-risk regions. The potential drop in population is evident both as time progresses and as the severity of the RCP scenario increases.

To achieve this goal, it is important to understand how abiotic factors influence pest dispersal behavior. We investigated the effects of abiotic conditions on flight initiation by the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. We first explored the effect of barometric pressure changes on flight initiation. We used a custom-made barometric chamber and observed the activity of D. citri as measured by the number of psyllids captured on yellow cardboard panels coated with adhesive. We found that psyllid flight initiation changed in response to variations in barometric pressure rather than to differences in stable pressures. Diaphorina citri were equally active at 1,009 mbar and 1,022 mbar. However, D. citri dispersed more as barometric pressure increased, and less when barometric pressure decreased. In a subsequent experiment, we manipulated temperature and relative humidity and observed how D. citri dispersed between citrus plants. Psyllids dispersal increased linearly with temperature. Changes in humidity did not affect dispersal of D. citri. Less than 1% of psyllids dispersed at 15 degrees C, compared with 7.7% at 21 degrees C and 27% at 25 degrees C. The minimal threshold for D. citri to initiate flight is estimated to be 16.5 degrees C.

In the case of seeds with a high economic value, as is the case of nuts from the Mediterranean stone pine (Pinus pinea L), predispersal predation can also result in severe economic losses. The insect-seed relationship shows complex spatiotemporal dynamics, including patterns of dependency between fruit availability and fluctuations in insect population, occurrence of insect outbreaks, spatial contagion and masting habit. In the present study, we focus on the damage caused by a native pest, the Dioryctria mendacella Stgr. moth, to cones and seeds of P. pinea, a forest species showing a marked masting habit. We firstly identified those environmental and stand-level factors controlling the spatiotemporal pattern of damage by D. mendacella, as well as the self-regulatory effect that interannual variability in seed production could have on the population dynamics of the moth. In a second phase, we constructed a predictive phenomenological model to forecast the probability of cone damage in a given location, as well as the expected patterns of spatiotemporal spread and dispersion. Our results revealed a strong correlation between the probability of damage and crop size in a given year, pointing to a dependency between feeding resources and predator population. Additionally, the probability of damage is affected by the number of damaged cones observed in the previous year, indicating temporal contagion. Cone and seed damage is also affected by the temperature during different phases of the complex life-cycle of D. mendacella, which suggests that breakout processes are synchronized within the territory and linked to the occurrence of bumper crops and favorable climatic conditions. We detected that the level of infestation at a given location is related to site and environmental conditions, with no significant pattern of contagion/spreading from stands with high resource availability to those with low availability. Damage prediction under warmer climate scenarios reveals a counterbalance among favorable/unfavorable conditions for insect expansion and expected decline in cone production, resulting in only slight changes.

Determination of the pest's population life table parameters is essential for understanding population development and growth under a variety of climates and as part of a pest risk analysis. The development, mortality and reproduction were studied in two pest populations (from Peru and Ecuador) in which cohorts of each life stage were exposed to different constant temperatures ranging from 10 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Using the Insect Life Cycle Modeling software, nonlinear equations were fitted to the data and an overall phenology model established to simulate life table parameters based on temperature. The temperature-dependent development curve was statistically well described for eggs by Ratkowsky's model and for larvae and pupae by Taylor's model. Variability in development time among individuals independent of temperature was significantly described by a log-logistic model. Temperature effects on immature mortality were described using different nonlinear models. Optimal temperature for survival was between 14 degrees and 17 degrees C. Temperature effects on adult senescence and oviposition time were described by simple exponential models; within-group variability was described by a Weibull distribution function. Fecundity per female due to temperature followed a nonlinear model indicating maximum reproduction at similar to 17 degrees C.

J,"Dale, AG; Frank, SD",Warming and drought combine to increase pest insect fitness on urban trees,"Urban habitats are characterized by impervious surfaces, which increase temperatures and reduce water availability to plants. The effects of these conditions on herbivorous insects are not well understood, but may provide insight into future conditions. Three primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain why multiple herbivorous arthropods are more abundant and damaging in cities, and support has been found for each. First, less complex vegetation may reduce biological control of pests. Second, plant stress can increase plant quality for pests. And third, urban warming can directly increase pest fitness and abundance. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and the effects of temperature and plant stress are particularly related. Thus, we test the hypothesis that urban warming and drought stress combine to increase the fitness and abundance of the scale insect, Melanaspis tenebricosa, an urban tree pest that is more abundant in urban than rural areas of the southeastern U.S. We did this by manipulating drought stress across an existing mosaic of urban warming. We found support for the additive effect of temperature and drought stress such that female embryo production and body size increased with temperature and was greater on drought stressed than watered trees. This study provides further evidence that drivers of pest insect outbreaks act in concert, rather than independently, and calls for more research that manipulates multiple abiotic factors related to urbanization and climate change to predict their effects on ecological interactions. As cities expand and the climate changes, warmer temperatures and drought conditions may become more widespread in the native range of this pest.

These relationships were examined in this study based on the age-stage, two-sex life table of P. crisonalis developed in the laboratory at 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 36 degrees C. The results showed that the values of S-xj (age-stage-specific survival rate), f(xj) (age-stage-specific fecundity), l(x) (age specific survival rate) and m(x) (age-specific fecundity) increased as the temperature rose from 21 to 27 degrees C, then decreased from 30 to 36 degrees C. Temperature also had a significant effect on the net reproductive rate (R-0), gross reproductive rate (GRR), intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (gimel.). The value of these parameters were at low levels at 21, 33, and 36 degrees C. Further, the r value decreased as the temperature rose from 24 to 30 degrees C, while the GRR reached its highest level at 27 degrees C.

Their respective natural histories are well documented but correlations between developmental benchmarks (e.g., larval eclosion) and degree-day accruals are not yet known. Treatment timings are critical to the optimization of any given control tactic, and degree-day accrual facilitates optimization by quantifying the developmental status of pest populations. When key developmental benchmarks in the pest life cycle are linked to degree-days, real-time weather data can be used to predict precise treatment timings. Here, we provide the degree-day accumulations associated with discrete biological events (i.e., initiation of flight and peak flight) for the three most consistent moth pests of cranberries in Wisconsin. Moths were trapped each spring and summer from 2003 to 2011. To characterize flight dynamics and average timing of flight initiation, pheromone-baited trap-catch data were tallied for all three pest species within each of seven growing seasons. These flight dynamics were then associated with the corresponding degree-day accumulations generated using the cranberry plant's developmental thresholds. Finally, models were fit to the data in order to determine the peak flight of each species. The initiation of the spring flight among all three moth species was highly synchronous, aiding in the timing of control tactics; however, there were substantial differences in the timing of peak flight among the moth species. Characterization of the relationship between temperature and pest development allows pest management professionals to target specific life stages, improving the efficacy of any given pest control tactic.",no,,,,,INSECTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2075-4450,NA,2017,10.3390/insects8010026,WOS:000398717700025

Isolated snails reproduced without cross fertilization. These snails deposited small clusters of eggs (3-7 per d) totaling about 20 per mo once oviposition commenced (after about 50 d). The snails grew rapidly for 50 d, attaining a mass of about 25 mg, then grew more slowly, eventually attaining a mass of about 50 mg after 250 d. Hatching occurred over a wide range of temperatures. The mean duration of the egg stage decreased from 18.7 to 8.0 d as the temperature increased from 19.5 to 32.0 degrees C. Allopeas gracile was omnivorous, feeding on green plants (vegetables, weeds, and flowers), fungi (cultivated mushroom and sooty mold), and animal matter (dead cockroaches and earthworms), but not decaying vegetation (tree leaves). Although this species is omnivorous, many plants allowed only maintenance, not fostering rapid growth.

S. catenifer is the best-known pest of `Hass' avocado fruit. The S. catenifer sex pheromone was used to capture male S. catenifer in Criollo avocado orchards at different elevations at Chiapas, Mexico from September 2012 to August 2013. Polynomial regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between numbers of moths caught and weather factors (precipitation and temperature).

Initial S. catenifer captures coincided with crop flowering and presence of avocado fruit, independently of the altitude at the site. S. catenifer was caught frequently at the low-altitude site from December to January, while captures increased from February to May at higher altitude. Moths captured and precipitation were positively correlated at the low-altitude site; moths captured were correlated with temperature but not with rainfall at the high-altitude site.

J,"Huang, J; Li, J",Spring phenology of cotton bollworm affects wheat yield,"Climate change has changed numerous species phenologies. Understanding the asynchronous responses between pest insects and host plants to climate change is helpful in improving integrated pest management. It is necessary to use long-term data to analyze the effects of climate change on cotton bollworm and wheat anthesis. Data for cotton bollworm, wheat yield, and wheat anthesis collected since 1990 were analyzed using linear regression and partial least-squares regression, as well as the Mann-Kendall test. The results showed that warmer temperatures in the spring advanced the phenologies of cotton bollworm and wheat anthesis, but the phenology changes in overwintering cotton bollworm were faster than those in wheat anthesis, and the eclosion period of overwintering was prolonged, resulting in an increase in overwintering adult abundance. This might lead to more first-generation larvae and subsequent wheat damage. An early or late first-appearance date significantly affected the eclosion days. The abrupt changes of phenologies in cotton bollworm, wheat anthesis, and climate were asynchronous, but the abrupt phenology changes occurred after or around the climate abrupt change, especially after or around the abrupt changes of temperature in March and April. The expansion of asynchronous responses in the change rate of wheat anthesis and overwintering cotton bollworm would likely decrease wheat yield due to climate warming in the future. Accumulated temperature was the major affecting factor on the first eclosion date (t(1)), adult abundance, and eclosion days. Temperatures in March and April and precipitation in the winter mainly affected the prepeak date (t(2)), peak date (t(3)), and postpeak date (t(4)), respectively, and these factors indirectly affected wheat yield.

Understanding these dynamics is critical to developing effective integrated pest management strategies. Here we studied the seasonal phenology and feeding activity of two wireworm species that are major pests of wheat crops in the Pacific Northwestern United States, Limonius californicus and L. infuscatus. We conducted monthly sampling of the damaging larval stages of both species in commercial spring wheat fields in Washington and Idaho throughout 2013 and 2014. These data were used to model the seasonal phenology and feeding activity of each species in relation to soil temperature. We found larvae of both species were most abundant relatively early in the season, with total wireworms captures in soil cores declining as the season progressed. Larvae of both species were collected predominantly in the top 70 cm of the soil profile, suggesting that they primarily feed on plant roots and seeds up to this depth. While patterns of seasonal abundance of both species were similar, feeding activity varied significantly between the two species. Our results indicate that as spring moves into summer L. californicus feeds more aggressively, whereas the activity of L. infuscatus decreases as the crop season progresses. These differences might help explain why L. californicus is generally a more economically damaging pest that also threatens winter crops, while damage from L. infuscatus is generally limited to the spring. Accordingly, management strategies for each species should be tailored to their specific seasonal dynamics.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1612-4758,1612-4766,2017,10.1007/s10340-016-0750-y,WOS:000394267400006
J,"Merrill, SC; Peairs, FB",Temperature variability is a key component in accurately forecasting the effects of climate change on pest phenology,"BACKGROUND: Models describing the effects of climate change on arthropod pest ecology are needed to help mitigate and adapt to forthcoming changes. Challenges arise because climate data are at resolutions that do not readily synchronize with arthropod biology. Here we explain how multiple sources of climate and weather data can be synthesized to quantify the effects of climate change on pest phenology. RESULTS: Predictions of phenological events differ substantially between models that incorporate scale-appropriate temperature variability and models that do not. As an illustrative example, we predicted adult emergence of a pest of sunflower, the sunflower stem weevil Cylindrocopturus adspersus (LeConte). Predictions of the timing of phenological events differed by an average of 11 days between models with different temperature variability inputs. Moreover, as temperature variability increases, developmental rates accelerate. CONCLUSION: Our work details a phenological modeling approach intended to help develop tools to plan for and mitigate the effects of climate change. Results show that selection of scale-appropriate temperature data is of more importance than selecting a climate change emission scenario. Predictions derived without appropriate temperature variability inputs will likely result in substantial phenological event miscalculations. Additionally, results suggest that increased temperature instability will lead to accelerated pest development.

The impact of five constant temperatures (17, 21, 25, 29, and 33 degrees C) on the life table of A. dissimilis was studied using age-stage, two-sex life table method in the laboratory. The results showed that the developmental time of egg, larva, pupa, and adult decreased when temperature increased from 17 degrees C to 33 degrees C. The TPOP (total preoviposition period) decreased with temperature increasing from 17 degrees C to 29 degrees C, while the longest APOP (adult preoviposition period) occurred at 21 degrees C (3.57d) and the shortest at 33 degrees C (2.15d).

For secondary forest pests, such as the pine bark beetle Ips sexdentatus, the resulting increase in population level could trigger more frequent outbreaks. However, this positive effect could be outweighed by a temperature-dependent decrease in offspring quality. To test these hypotheses, we carried out a laboratory rearing experiment with maritime pine logs at six temperature regimes reproducing hourly fluctuations and averaging 12-25.5 degrees C. We estimated the thermal requirements for a complete development of the beetle and the number of offspring per female. The offspring quality was estimated using three traits: dry body weight, elytra length and lipid content. The minimum and maximum developmental threshold were estimated at 10.9 and 36 degrees C, respectively, and the thermal requirements for complete development were estimated at 517 degree-days. We predicted a mean of two generations per year in southwestern France, although an additional generation could occur during warmer years. The number of offspring increased exponentially with temperature, although we observed a curvilinear response of offspring traits to temperature, with optima at 15-18 degrees C. This suggests that there are trade-offs between productivity and quality of offspring.

We compared the life-history characteristics of cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch) across different temperature regimes on two different host plants, soybean (a preferred host) and cotton (a non-preferred host). Most demographic parameters were superior for the aphid on soybean than on cotton. Temperatures affected aphid development more on cotton than on soybean. The intrinsic rate of increase, reproduction rate, number of progeny per adult, and longevity were significantly higher on soybean than on cotton for the same temperature regime. Temperatures that fluctuated to extreme levels caused a rapid decline in each of these parameters for aphids fed on cotton, but not for those fed on soybean. To our knowledge, this is the first report to note that the high-temperature tolerance of A. craccivora is host-specific (cotton vs. soybean).

Its production is however limited due to high prevalence of pests and diseases among other abiotic and biotic factors. A study was designed to aid understanding the knowledge of farmers about pests and their perception about climate variability impacts, as well as documenting the phenology of sweetpotato pests (pest population dynamics) in relationship with weather factors. The paper aimed at determined which climatic factors may be used as best predictors of the different status of pest populations (declines, outbreaks). Farmer based data was obtained using a semi structured questionnaire administered to several of farmers. Population dynamics of sweetpotato pests were monitored year-round from 2005 to 2015 in South Kivu province, eastern DRCongo. Field monitoring (visual counts) observations (population dynamic of different soil-dwelling and surface dwelling arthropods visiting sweetpotato fields) combined with a survey of farmers' knowledge on sweetpotato pests and their practices in the management of these pests in SouthKivu Province were conducted for 11 years. Monitoring (with field observations and counts) was carried out in fields under different farming practices (monocropping and inter-cropping) in sites located at different altitudes. Similarly, data for climatic factors, for the same period, were collected from Lwiro Research center. Regression models were applied to understand the linkages between environmental factors (rainfall and temperature) and pest population dynamics. The results indicated that different varieties (local and improved ones) of sweetpotato are grown three times (3 seasons) per annum under various cropping systems (sole crop, mixed crops) in various agroecological zones at different altitudes. Various arthropod species visit the crop at its different stages of development including classically known pests (Acraea acerata, Cylas spp.) or as vectors of diseases (Bemisi tabaci, Aphis spp.). The results indicated a high fluctuation in the population density of different pests. The change in the population dynamics were characterized by gradual increase in the populations during rainy seasons followed by decline during dry seasons (hot months of the year). Significant (P<0.05) differences were observed in the population dynamics between sole sweetpotato and mixed sweetpotato intercropping. There was a synchronization of multiple pest generations (biannual, multiannual cycles of reproduction) built up with early rains. The results indicate that rainfall and maximum temperature were critical to the survival and population built up of the pest population. High rainfall in the previous months caused increases in the population density in the subsequent months within a year. The population dynamic (seasonal occurrence) over months and years was likely to coincide with favorable feeding and breeding conditions available within sweetpotato biotopes when temperatures were sufficiently high or after heavy rainfall. For some species, maximum temperature and dry seasons were associated with declines in the pest populations whereas for other species, heavy rainfall was associated with subsequent outbreaks (high populations) in the following months of the years. It is likely that perturbations in temperature/ rainfall patterns may cause serious changes in the pest population, therefore favoring the build- up of multiple generations within a year, thus. Rainfall and maximum temperatures were reliable predictors of key pest species. In fact, regressions analyses indicated that there were significant relationships (P<0.01) between the fluctuation of the population density of different pest species and the variability of climatic factors (mean monthly maximum/minimum temperature, average rainfall). The population density of different insect pest species varied according to cropping system and to altitude. For example, a significant relationship (P<0.001) was observed between adult aphid population density and average maximum temperature whereas Cylas spp. correlated significantly (P<0.05) with rainfall at high and mid altitudes in both sole and mixed crops. The population density of Acraea acerata was not related to variability in rainfall because the species seemed to occur in number in crops (mono cropping and mixed crops) in marshland areas in June-July and December-February. The virus pressure (measured as the number of leaves symptomatically showing virus attack) followed the population density of whiteflies and aphids. Population trends of other arthropod groups (millipedes, beetles) were not affected by crop variety (clones) or by the altitude or the climate variability but more by the farming practice (mixed or monoculture) implemented by the farmer. It is possible that the resistance or tolerance of some varieties (bio-fortified/vitamin-rich/orange flesh varieties) may be reduced in the future under changing climatic conditions of crop growing in the region with Maximum temperature as the key driver of changes in the population density. The ability to predict the severity of pest populations from mean monthly rainfall/temperature data will provide a significant input into the development of IPM programme for sweetpotato pest species. The data indicates that building resilient sweetpotato crops will require the consideration of various approaches.

The current study examined nematode life-stage progression and generation time on yellow pea as affected by temperature with the related pest, D. dipsaci, used as a positive control. Relationships for body length of the two nematode species and life stage were unaffected by rearing on plant hosts compared with carrot disks. Then plant-reared J4 individuals of both nematode species were used to determine the effect of temperature (17, 22, and 27 degrees C) on life-stage progression and minimum generation time with yellow pea. At 17 and 22 degrees C, D. weischeri 14 individuals progressed to only the adult stage whereas, at 27 degrees C, the minimum generation time from J4 to J4 was 30 days or 720 growing degree-days. The minimum generation time for D. dipsaci was 24, 18, and 22 days or 336, 342, and 528 growing degree-days at 17, 22, and 27 degrees C, respectively.

J,"Pheakdey, DV; Xuan, TD; Khanh, TD",Influence of Climate Factors on Rice Yields in Cambodia,"Temperature and precipitation have been known as the key determinant factors to affect rice production in climate change. In this study, the relationship between climate variables and rice yields during 1993-2012 in Cambodia was analyzed and evaluated. The Ordinary Least Squares analysis was applied to examine the relationship of three climate variables (TCV) including maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall against seasonal rice yields. By this period, a remarkable increasing trend of annual temperature was observed whilst rainfall was not significantly changed. The TCV explains approximately 63% and 56% of the variability of rice yields in wet and dry seasons, respectively. It is found that in Cambodia, non-climate factors such as fertilizers, water, cultivars, and soil fertility cause 40% variation to rice yields, whereas the remaining 60% can be influenced by climate variability. The levels of temperature difference (LTD) between maximum and minimum temperatures of the wet season (WS) and dry season (DS) were 7.0 and 8.6 degrees C, respectively. The lower value of LTD may cause the reduction of rice in WS (2.2 tons/ha) as compared to that of DS (3.0 tons/ha). Rice yield has increased 50.5% and 33.8% in DS and WS, respectively, may due to the improvement of rice cultivation practices in Cambodia such as the better use of fertilizers, pest and weed control, and irrigation, and more effective rice cultivated protocol, as the increased trend of temperature may detrimentally affect rice yield.

This pest takes on a new importance with the reduction of active ingredients available to growers for crop protection and the absence of good alternatives easily usable by growers. Research is being conducted on risk forecasting models, in particular the German model SWAT. Unfortunately, SWAT does not yet allow a suitable forecast of the risks: the first flight is predicted too early under the conditions of southwest France but also in the west, the flight predicted for June-July is generally not observed in the south, and the third flight is predicted too early. Firstly, we have observed that in the south and west of France the overwintering form is larvae and not pupae like in the more northern zones. Secondly, pupal estivation is not really taken into account by the model explaining the difficulty to have a reliable forecast for the last flight.

J,"Schowalter, TD",Biology and Management of the Forest Tent Caterpillar (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae),"The forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria Hubner (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) is a widespread defoliator that is native throughout most of the continental United States and Canada south of 61 degrees N latitude. Larvae feed on a wide variety of hosts across their geographic range, but local populations perform best on local host species. Defoliation during outbreaks can strip preferred trees of all foliage and cause substantial branch mortality and growth reduction but generally does not cause much tree mortality, at least not directly. Defoliation in recreational areas reduces visitation because migrating caterpillars are viewed as nuisances and defoliated trees as unsightly. The insects, their frass, and associated damage to ornamental trees and shrubs also are nuisances for homeowners. The current importance of the forest tent caterpillar and its potential to become more important in a warmer climate warrant greater attention to its population dynamics and control options. Because 1) outbreaks of this native insect generally cause little long-term damage to forest values, 2) widespread application of insecticides is cost prohibitive, and 3) forests are increasingly valued as reservoirs of biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services, microbial insecticides, such as Bt, spinosad, and baculovirus formulations, are favored over synthetic insecticides for control of this insect when warranted. Other biorational insecticides include azadirachtin (a botanical insecticide) and insecticidal soap. Conventional synthetic insecticides include several pyrethroids (such as bifenthrin and permethrin), organophosphates (such as acephate and malathion), and carbamates (carbaryl), but these have broad nontarget effects that discourage use in forests.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,2155-7470,2017,10.1093/jipm/pmx022,WOS:000419281300010

However, relatively little attention has been paid to biotic interactions, and how these might also change with landscape-wide and local factors. Ecological interactions between plants and insect herbivores are likely to alter species performance and affect local abundance, but their role in the Australian Alps remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the prediction that the amount of herbivory on saplings of the dominant high elevation tree, snow gum Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieb. ex Spreng.

Using a reciprocal transplant experiment, we tested the prediction that origin of seed (low, mid, high elevation) has less effect on insect herbivory than environmentally-driven changes in plant morphology (height, leaf thickness, specific leaf area). Across all mountains studied, herbivory was best explained by a combination of plant height, canopy openness, leaf thickness and elevation, but not seed origin. This study highlights the individuality of each mountain environment, at landscape and local scales, as well as the complexity of relationships between environmental change, plants and insects.

A model of pine weevil attack was constructed using various site characteristics, including both climatic factors and factors related to forest management activities.

Their role in natural pest control is important due to their predatory polyphagous nutrition and bioindicative value since they are sensitive to environmental and anthropogenic changes. Therefore, the main objectives were to understand how common arable cropping systems in Croatia affect ground beetles abundance in respect to the environmental conditions. We hypothesized that environmental specifics (soil type and structure, climatic conditions) together with cultivation measures (tillage and insecticide application) would affect ground beetle activity and abundance. The research was conducted in two locations Lukac, Virovitica - Podravina County and Tovarnik, Vukovar - Sirmium County. Ground beetles were collected weekly, from May to September 2015, by epigeic pitfall traps and endogeic perforated probes from fields sown with typical arable crops in these areas. In total, 2,582 ground beetle individuals were collected using epigeic traps, and 323 ground beetles were collected using endogeic traps.

The cowpea aphid adapts to changing environmental conditions, particularly to high temperatures as well as to different host plants. Its adaptation strategies can be seen in its biology, morphology and behaviour.

Global climate and atmospheric change are widely predicted to affect many ecosystems. Herbivorous insects account for 25% of the planet's species so their responses to environmental change are pivotal to how future ecosystems will function. Atmospheric change affects feeding guilds differently, however, with sap-feeding herbivores consistently identified as net beneficiaries of predicted increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO(2)). The mechanistic basis for these effects remains largely unknown, and our understanding about how multiple environmental changes, acting in tandem, shape plant-insect interactions is incomplete. 2. This study investigated how increases in temperature (eT) and eCO(2) affected the performance of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) via changes in amino acid concentrations in the model legume, lucerne (Medicago sativa). 3. Aphid performance increased under eCO(2) at ambient temperatures, whereby aphid fecundity, longevity, colonization success and r(m) increased by 42%, 30%, 25% and 21%, respectively. eT negated the positive effects of eCO(2) on both fecundity and r(m), however, and performance was similar to when aphids were reared at ambient CO2. 4. We identified discrete functional groups of amino acids that underpinned the effects of climate and atmospheric change, in addition to plant genotype, on aphid performance. Effects of eT and eCO(2) held true across five M. sativa genotypes, demonstrating the generality of their effects. 5. Combining this knowledge with amino acid profiles of existing cultivars raises the possibility of predicting future susceptibility to aphids and preventing outbreaks of a global pest. Moreover, environmentally induced changes in the nutritional ecology of aphids have the capacity to change life-history strategies of aphids and their direct and indirect interactions with many other organisms, including mutualists and antagonists.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0269-8463,1365-2435,2017,10.1111/1365-2435.12715,WOS:000394372700018

Adult spruce bark beetles are well-adapted to survive over winter however, the ability of sub-adult stages to overwinter has not been clearly established. The increase in average temperature recorded over the last three decades has resulted in an increase in voltinism by one generation, but due to insufficient time the last generation may not complete its development. It is crucial to investigate the survival and development of sub-adult stages at low temperatures in order to predict the effect of increased voltinism on the population dynamics of this species. We measured the development and survival of larvae and pupae (over 12 weeks) in logs kept at winter temperatures outdoors (in shade and exposed to sunlight) and in the laboratory (at 0 and 5 degrees C), with 10 degrees C as a control, at which normal development was expected. Overall, findings revealed that development continued at low temperatures, although it was slower than at high temperatures. Importantly, after 12 weeks significant numbers of spruce bark beetles were present, including newly emerged adults.

J,"Jakobs, R; Ahmadi, B; Houben, S; Gariepy, TD; Sinclair, BJ",Cold tolerance of third-instar Drosophila suzukii larvae,"Drosophila suzukii is an emerging global pest of soft fruit; although it likely overwinters as an adult, larval cold tolerance is important both for determining performance during spring and autumn, and for the development of temperature-based control methods aimed at larvae. We examined the low temperature biology of third instar feeding and wandering larvae in and out of food. We induced phenotypic plasticity of thermal biology by rearing under short days and fluctuating temperatures (5.5-19 degrees C). Rearing under fluctuating temperatures led to much slower development (42.1 days egg-adult) compared to control conditions (constant 21.5 degrees C; 15.7 days), and yielded larger adults of both sexes. D. suzukii larvae were chill-susceptible, being killed by low temperatures not associated with freezing, and freezing survival was not improved when ice formation was inoculated externally via food or silver iodide. Feeding larvae were more cold tolerant than wandering larvae, especially after rearing under fluctuating temperatures, and rearing under fluctuating temperatures improved survival of prolonged cold (0 degrees C) to beyond 72 h in both larval stages. There was no evidence that acute cold tolerance could be improved by rapid cold hardening. We conclude that D. suzukii has the capacity to develop at low temperatures under fluctuating temperatures, but that they have limited cold tolerance. However, phenotypic plasticity of prolonged cold tolerance must be taken into account when developing low temperature treatments for sanitation of this species.

In a warming climate, timely salvage and sanitation cuttings will be needed to guarantee the sustainability of the forestry. Several defoliating pests overwinter in the egg stage. Warmer winters may not kill the eggs and, therefore, the incidence of outbreaks is predicted to increase in the northern and continental areas.

Laboratory studies were conducted to assess the effects of temperature on the development, survival, longevity, fecundity and population parameter of A. obscurus at six constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 32, 35 degrees C). The hatchability was the lowest at 15 degrees C, the highest at 25 degrees C and no eggs hatched at 35 degrees C. Developmental rates increased linearly as the temperature increased. The lower developmental threshold temperature was 10.6 degrees C and 200 degree-days were required to complete development from egg to adult. Adult longevity decreased with increasing temperature, and ranged from 68.87 d at 15 degrees C to 16.41 d at 32 degrees C. The highest total fecundity occurred at 20 degrees C with 162 eggs per female. The temperature-dependent total fecundity, age-specific oviposition rate, and age-specific survival rate models were described. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was significantly higher at 30 and 32 degrees C (0.239 and 0.250) than at other temperatures. This study suggests that optimal developmental and reproductive temperatures for A. obscurus ranges between 25 and 30 degrees C and this may help this species adapt to warmer areas and widen its distribution and potential for damage in response to global warming.

However, these patterns are highly variable across studies suggesting other important factors, such as abiotic drivers, which are rarely included in landscape models, may also contribute to variability in insect population abundance. The objective of this study was to explicitly account for the contribution of temperature and precipitation, in addition to landscape composition, on the abundance of a widespread insect crop pest, the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura), in Wisconsin soybean fields. We hypothesized that higher soybean aphid abundance would be associated with higher heat accumulation (e.g., growing degree days) and increasing noncrop habitat in the surrounding landscape, due to the presence of the overwintering primary hosts of soybean aphid. To evaluate these hypotheses, we used an ecoinformatics approach that relied on a large dataset collected across Wisconsin over a 9-year period (2003-2011), for an average of 235 sites per year (n = 2,110 fields total). We determined surrounding landscape composition (1.5-km radius) using publicly available satellite-derived land cover imagery and interpolated daily temperature and precipitation information from the National Weather Service COOP weather station network. We constructed linear mixed models for soybean aphid abundance based on abiotic and landscape explanatory variables and applied model averaging for prediction using an information theoretic framework. Over this broad spatial and temporal extent in Wisconsin, we found that variation in growing season precipitation was positively related to soybean aphid abundance, while higher precipitation during the nongrowing season had a negative effect on aphid populations. Additionally, we found that aphid populations were higher in areas with proportionally more forest but were lower in areas where minor crops, such as small grains, were more prevalent. Thus, our findings support our hypothesis that including abiotic drivers increases our understanding of crop pest abundance and distribution. Moreover, by explicitly modeling abiotic factors, we may be able to explore how variable climate in tandem with land cover patterns may affect current and future insect populations, with potentially critical implications for crop yields and agricultural food webs.",yes,field,abundance,,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1051-0761,1939-5582,2016,10.1002/eap.1418,WOS:000389316400019

Much less is known on life history regulation for species inhabiting high-elevation areas in the subtropics at the southern extreme of their geographical range. Host plant phenology has been found to play a key role in generating allochronic isolation among sibling species and host races of Rhagoletis in the course of sympatric speciation, and has important implications for pest management. We compare the effect of winter length on survival to adult eclosion and dormancy duration among four species of Rhagoletis (three of them sympatric) exploiting hosts with different fruiting phenology in subtropical isolated highlands. Survival and duration of dormancy was found to be different among the four species. At 24 degrees C, a very small proportion (<1%) of R. pomonella, R. turpiniae and R. zoqui completed development without becoming dormant, while in the case of R. solanophaga the majority of the population emerged after development within 40 days of pupation. Also, a large proportion of braconid parasitoids infesting Rhagoletis eggs and larvae emerged as adults without becoming dormant. Greatest survival after artificial winter was obtained for R. pomonella (50-60%) and R. zoqui (30%) after only four weeks at 5 degrees C (a third of the time reported for studies on northern R. pomonella), while R. turpiniae, under identical environmental conditions experienced low adult emergence, and highest survival (11%) was recorded for flies exposed to 5 degrees C during 10 and 12 weeks. For R. pomonella, there was a strong positive relationship between winter length and time to post-winter adult eclosion that was not observed for R. zoqui. In sum, for R. pomonella, mild winters in highland subtropical areas appear to select for flies better able to withstand longer periods of warm temperature before winter than flies exploiting late fruiting hosts and inhabiting northern latitudes. In the case of R. turpiniae and R. zoqui environmental cues such as fluctuations in humidity and/or different temperature thresholds (5 degrees C) may play a more important role than winter length in life history regulation. Continuous host availability for R. solanophaga appears to have selected for non-diapausing flies.

The present study aims at identifying the most occurring insects-RFD in Sweden, and exploring the relationships between insects-RFD and climate and land management changes. The recorded insect attacks based on historical reports, literature and databases, were collected for North, Central and South of Sweden, and for two periods at yearly time scales: 1850-1950 and 1961-2014. A series of analyses has been carried out based on this dataset: 1 Estimation of the occurrence of each insects-RFD over years to assess which insect species have caused the major forest damage, 2-Ratios of broadleaved versus conifer host trees to estimate the main types of damaged forests, and 3-Canonical correspondence analyses to evaluate how much climate (winter and summer temperature, winter and summer precipitation, and storms) and land management (land areas for wood production, standing volume for all trees and standing volume for deciduous trees) changes have affected insects-RFD. The results reveal that the most occurring insects-RFD differ between the North and South of Sweden, and between 1850-1950 and 1961-2014. The most occurring insects-RFD since 1850 were Ips typographus, Neodiprion sertifer, Tortrix viridana, Hylobius abietis and Tomicus piniperda. The occurrences of insects-RFD have been higher in the South of Sweden since at least 1850 than in other regions. The North of Sweden have been mostly affected by insects-RFD between 1911 and 1950. Canonical correspondence analyses show that the spread of insects-RFD might be related to environmental conditions. More particularly, the insects-RFD variation explained are increasing between 1902-1950 and 1961-2007 in all Sweden for temperature (winter and summer) and in Central and South of Sweden for storm damage. However, the evolution of landscape management would participate in influencing insects-RFD, in particular from 1961, when changes in forest management (e.g. increase in land areas for wood production) have been developed, as well as the way to report insect forest damages. This long-term perspective of how changes in climate and land management have influenced insects-RFD is of great interest for further discussion about climate adaptation strategies in forestry and ecosystem services.

The pest outbreak initially occurred on the southwest slopes with mean values of 10A degrees and elevation of 400 m asl. The damages further extended both upward and downward, involving slopes of high steepness and the eastern exposure. The total area of the dead stands comprised 6000 ha, 45% of which were lost due to secondary pest (xylophagous insects) attacks. It is indicated that the use of remote sensing made it possible to determine the beginning of a pest outbreak with one-decade precision. The Siberian silk moth large-scale outbreak occurred against an increase in air temperatures, a decrease in precipitation, and a reduction in late frosts.

The collected adults were found to be vector of the fungus Geosmithia morbida Kolaik, Freeland, Utley & Tisserat, an aggressive pathogen causing thousand cankers disease in walnut (Juglans spp.). To determine the geographical distribution of the WTB and the main aspects of biology, phenology and voltinism, an intensive survey of the main walnut plantations near the site of the first finding was conducted in 2014. The beetles began to fly with a mean air temperature of about 18 degrees C (mid-May) and continued until late October. Two partially overlapping generations occurred, with the second taking place in late September. The WTB was found in 14 of the 27 monitored walnut plantations. The infested sites were spread over four different non-contiguous administrative provinces belonging to two regions (Veneto and Lombardy) of northern Italy. The most distant infested plantations were about 130km apart along a west-east gradient, and about 70km along a north-south gradient. In this respect, the distribution area of the WTB in northern Italy may be prudently estimated at about 4200km(2). Molecular analysis of the collected individuals showed no genetic differences among the six sampled P.juglandis populations, suggesting that a few individuals might have arrived in Italy through a single introduction event and then spread over the territory.

The aim of this work was to analyze the dynamics of the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), in Tuscany (Italy). We profited from long-term records of insect infestation and weather data available from the regional database and agrometeorological network. We tested whether the analysis of 13 years of monitoring campaigns can be used as basis for prediction models of B. oleae infestation. We related the percentage of infestation observed in the first part of the host-pest interaction and throughout the whole year to agrometeorological indices formulated for different time periods. A two-step approach was adopted to inspect the effect of weather on infestation: generalized linear model with a binomial error distribution and principal component regression to reduce the number of the agrometeorological factors and remove their collinearity. We found a consistent relationship between the degree of infestation and the temperature-based indices calculated for the previous period. The relationship was stronger with the minimum temperature of winter season. Higher infestation was observed in years following warmer winters. The temperature of the previous winter and spring explained 66 % of variance of early-season infestation. The temperature of previous winter and spring, and current summer, explained 72 % of variance of total annual infestation.

J,"Gherlenda, AN; Moore, BD; Haigh, AM; Johnson, SN; Riegler, M",Insect herbivory in a mature Eucalyptus woodland canopy depends on leaf phenology but not CO2 enrichment,"Background: Climate change factors such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (e[CO2]) and altered rainfall patterns can alter leaf composition and phenology. This may subsequently impact insect herbivory. In sclerophyllous forests insects have developed strategies, such as preferentially feeding on new leaf growth, to overcome physical or foliar nitrogen constraints, and this may shift under climate change. Few studies of insect herbivory at elevated [CO2] have occurred under field conditions and none on mature evergreen trees in a naturally established forest, yet estimates for leaf area loss due to herbivory are required in order to allow accurate predictions of plant productivity in future climates. Here, we assessed herbivory in the upper canopy of mature Eucalyptus tereticornis trees at the nutrient-limited Eucalyptus free-air CO2 enrichment (EucFACE) experiment during the first 19 months of CO2 enrichment. The assessment of herbivory extended over two consecutive spring-summer periods, with a first survey during four months of the [CO2] ramp-up phase after which full [CO2] operation was maintained, followed by a second survey period from months 13 to 19. Results: Throughout the first 2 years of EucFACE, young, expanding leaves sustained significantly greater damage from insect herbivory (between 25 and 32 % leaf area loss) compared to old or fully expanded leaves (less than 2 % leaf area loss). This preference of insect herbivores for young expanding leaves combined with discontinuous production of new foliage, which occurred in response to rainfall, resulted in monthly variations in leaf herbivory. In contrast to the significant effects of rainfall-driven leaf phenology, elevated [CO2] had no effect on leaf consumption or preference of insect herbivores for different leaf age classes. Conclusions: In the studied nutrient-limited natural Eucalyptus woodland, herbivory contributes to a significant loss of young foliage. Leaf phenology is a significant factor that determines the level of herbivory experienced in this evergreen sclerophyllous woodland system, and may therefore also influence the population dynamics of insect herbivores. Furthermore, leaf phenology appears more strongly impacted by rainfall patterns than by e[CO2]. e[CO2] responses of herbivores on mature trees may only become apparent after extensive CO2 fumigation periods.",no,,,,,BMC ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1472-6785,NA,2016,10.1186/s12898-016-0102-z,WOS:000386099600001

J,"Lundin, O; Rundlof, MJ; Smith, HG; Bommarco, R",Historical change and drivers of insect pest abundances in red clover seed production,"Plant-feeding insects reduce yields substantially in all major crops despite considerable crop protection efforts. A lack of long-term monitoring data and insufficient ecological knowledge of pest insects limit our possibilities to characterize drivers of change in their abundances. We demonstrate how a suite of complementary methods and data sources can be used to analyse historical shifts in pest abundance and species composition when continuous monitoring data for pest insects and their natural enemies are lacking. We compared historic and current abundances of seed weevils (Protapion spp.) in red clover fields grown for seed in southernmost Sweden using data from 60 fields 1935-1937 and 53 fields 2008-2011 respectively. We found higher pest abundances in the current data, and parasitism rates provided by wasps appeared to be lower in recent times compared with the 1930s. A separate analysis of 1504 observations of the insect pest species made 1936-2012 and reported into a public database showed that a formerly subdominant seed weevil species, Protapion trifolii L. has now become the dominating pest species, whereas Protapion apricans Hbst became relatively less common over time. This shift correlated with increased spring temperatures in the study area. Finally, we analysed if the proportion farmland in the surrounding landscape, temperature, precipitation and distance to nearest clover field in the previous year could explain pest abundances 2008-2011. We found that fields with less precipitation that were embedded in landscapes with a high proportion of farmland at the 5 km radius had higher pest abundances. Our results combined suggest that landscape scale changes in agricultural land use and increased spring temperatures both have contributed to the increased pest abundances observed 2008-2011 compared to 1935-1937. This study illustrates that a combination of approaches can compensate for the common situation when continuous long-term monitoring data is lacking, and improve our understanding of historic versus current insect pest abundances and the potential drivers of change.

In this context, understanding the key factors governing the population dynamics of the pest is important for development of management strategies. This study aimed to identify the larval parasitoids associated with P. xylostella and investigate the biotic (crop subspecies, plant age and parasitism) and abiotic factors (minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall, relative humidity and planting season) affecting the population dynamics of the pest in organic crops located in Southern Parana State, Brazil. Despite the continuous and abundant availability of host plants throughout the year, P. xylostella occurred between June and November, and the largest peaks of abundance were observed between August and September, when low temperatures and rainfall were recorded. According to the stepwise regression analysis, P. xylostella was more abundant in broccoli during winter. Neither temperature, nor rainfall significantly influenced pest abundance. Four species of larval parasitoids were identified associated with the pest, of which Diadegma leontiniae (Brethes) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), Apanteles piceotrichosus Blanchard (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Siphona sp. Meigen (Diptera: Tachinidae) were abundant, while Oomyzus sokolowskii (Kurdjumov) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) was rarely found. Parasitism was the major factor influencing population dynamics of P. xylostella, contributing to 48% of the variation in pest abundance. These results show the importance of larval parasitoids complex in regulating P. xylostella population and that the temperature and rainfall recorded during field experiments did not influenced pest abundance.

Aphids from laboratory-reared colonies and directly collected from the field in early summer were used to study their development, survival and reproduction under a range of constant temperatures. Life-table parameters suggest that A. gossypii performed better than Ac. gossypii under all temperature treatments tested, and the difference tended to be strongest under high temperatures.

The presence of this pest in North America is a concern and assessing the risk of potential infestation and damage can help guide regional management strategies. We have developed a continuous time stage structured population model parameterized with empirical data based on laboratory observations. The principle environmental driver of vital rates (mortality, fecundity and development) for the model is temperature though our results suggest that reproductive diapause and quality of fruit available to the population may also have significant effect on population size.

In Morocco, where high temperatures are prevailing in a growing season, sexual traps demonstrate a massive flight of codling moth leading to an intensive chemical control. In Morocco, data concerning its life cycle are imprecise. Thus, its voltinism and the impact of temperatures on the progress of its generations were investigated during six growing seasons (2010-2015) in a Moroccan apple orchard. The degree days method was also investigated to verify the adaptability of codling moth populations to phenological models. Results revealed that codling moth flight consisted on three generations per year, whereas an additional fourth generation of moths is expected when the beginning of the life cycle (first generation) matches with high temperatures. The present study highlighted the importance of the first generation on codling moth control, as it represented around 50% of captures per year. The accumulation of an average of 360 degree days during April and May allowed an earlier and faster development of the first generation, which impacted the progress of the following generations, extended the presence of the insect, and consequently increased its voltinism. Moreover, temperatures during the period conducive to insect diapause (July to early August) are always high in Moroccan conditions and thus inhibit insect diapause. Finally, the estimated generations, based on degree days method, were in concordance with codling moth flight dynamics based on sexual traps captures, making possible the prediction of insect development pattern using a phenological model.",no,,,,,ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0013-8746,1938-2901,2016,10.1093/aesa/saw046,WOS:000384436900004

Regarding Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae), one of the worst threats to palm trees worldwide, laboratory experiments have been conducted to analyze their flight potential. However, these data must be complemented with tests that allow us to know its flight behaviour and dispersal patterns under field conditions. Two mark-release-recapture experiments were conducted in areas with R. ferrugineus infestations. In the first, the effects of weevil sex, temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity, on the take-off and flight mobility of adults were analyzed. The second experiment aimed to determine the maximum flight distance covered by adults in field. The take-off rate for R. ferrugineus males was significantly greater than for females, and was positively influenced by temperature (optimum take-off around 25 degrees C) and solar radiation, both factors being highly correlated. Female weevil recaptures were significantly higher, especially as temperatures increased (optimum recapture around 21 degrees C). Dispersal distances of weevil adults increased when temperatures rose, and while this insect tended to fly short distances (<500 m), it was able to cover up to 7 km. The dispersal of R. ferrugineus adults mainly occurred during the first 7 days after their release, and when relative humidity increased, their dispersal time was reduced.

The rice plants treated with chemical fertilizers (CF) accumulated higher content of available nitrogen (NH4+ + NO3-) and grew higher and more luxuriantly, but they were more susceptible to pests and diseases. Comparatively, the plants treated with organic manure demonstrated higher resistance to rice pests and diseases and grew more healthily. However, excessive application of organic manure also increased the risks of pests and diseases. The unfertilized plants were highly deficient in nutrients, but they maintained the lowest rates of pests and diseases. This suggests that rice pests and diseases were easily triggered by a high content of N-related nutrients in plant tissues and inhibited by nutrient deficiency. Annual climatic conditions also deeply affected the occurrences of rice pests and diseases. Long-term warm and humid weather in the growing areas favored the development of herbivorous pests and fungal diseases. The incidence of migratory pests in Shanghai is also linked to violent summer storms. Frequent rain storms in southern or southwestern China increased the chance of infestations of migratory pests in Shanghai. Rice yield was primarily determined by the infestations of pests and diseases. In the pest-infested year of 2012, the grain yield for the different fertilizers was only 40%-44% of that under conventional farming practices, and the yield in CF was even significantly lower than that in the unfertilized CK. In 2013, with lower infestation rates, the grain yield of the different fertilizers was more than 80% of the conventional yield.

Each of these pests directly damages potato foliage or tubers; C. tenellus and M. persicae also transmit pathogens that can drastically reduce potato yields. We monitored the seasonal population dynamics of these pests by conducting weekly sampling on a network of commercial farms from 2007 to 2014. Using these data, we developed phenology models to characterize the seasonal population dynamics of each pest based on accumulated degree-days (DD). All three pests exhibited consistent population dynamics across seasons that were mediated by temperature. Of the three pests, C. tenellus was generally the first detected in potato crops, with 90% of adults captured by 936 DD. In contrast, populations of P. operculella and M. persicae built up more slowly over the course of the season, with 90% cumulative catch by 1,590 and 2,634 DD, respectively.

J,"Mollaei, M; Izadi, H; Simek, P; Kostal, V","Overwintering biology and limits of cold tolerance in larvae of pistachio twig borer, Kermania pistaciella","Pistachio twig borer, Kermania pistaciella is an important pest of pistachio trees. It has an univoltine life-cycle and its larvae tunnel and feed inside pistachio twigs for almost 10 months each year. The last larval instars overwinter inside the twigs. Survival/mortality associated with low temperatures during overwintering stage is currently unknown. We found that overwintering larvae of the Rafsanjan (Iran) population of K. pistaciella rely on maintaining a stably high supercooling capacity throughout the cold season. Their supercooling points (SCPs) ranged between -19.4 and -22.7 degrees C from October to February. Larvae were able to survive 24 h exposures to -15 degrees C anytime during the cold season. During December and January, larvae were undergoing quiescence type of dormancy caused probably by low ambient temperatures and/or changes in host tree physiology (tree dormancy). Larvae attain highest cold tolerance (high survival at -20 degrees C) during dormancy, which offers them sufficient protection against geographically and ecologically relevant cold spells. High cold tolerance during dormancy was not associated with accumulation of any low-molecular mass cryoprotective substances. The SCP sets the limit of cold tolerance in pistachio twig borer, meaning that high mortality of overwintering populations can be expected only in the regions or years where or when the temperatures fall below the average larval SCP (i.e., below -20 degrees C). Partial mortality can be expected also when temperatures repeatedly drop close to the SCP on a diurnal basis.",no,,,,,BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0007-4853,1475-2670,2016,10.1017/S0007485316000237,WOS:000379418000014

It is univoltine and over-winters in the egg stage. Larvae and adults feed on the foliage of Allium plants. To assess the requirements to terminate egg diapause and subsequent effects on post-diapause development rate, eggs were held at different temperature regimes. Exposure to low temperatures was required to terminate egg diapause. Prolonged exposure (2 mo vs 1 mo) to 5 degrees C and outside ambient conditions (mean temperature: 10.5 degrees C; range: -7.1-21.6 degrees C) enhanced the termination of egg diapause. Prolonged exposure also reduced the time to egg hatch; e.g., eggs held for 2 mo versus 1 mo at 5 degrees C developed more quickly when subsequently placed at warmer temperatures. Egg hatch was observed at 17, 21, 25, and 29 degrees C, but not at 15 degrees C. Regression analysis identified 16.2 degrees C as the minimum temperature for post-diapause development.

Cooler rearing temperatures (15 degrees C) resulted in larger, darker winter morph (WM) adults than summer morph flies reared at optimal temperatures (25 degrees C). Abdominal pigmentation scores and body size measurements of laboratory-reared WMs were similar to those of D. suzukii females captured in late autumn in Geneva, NY. We evaluated reproductive diapause and cold hardiness in live-captured D. suzukii WMs as well as WMs reared in the laboratory from egg to adult under four developmental conditions: static cool temperatures (SWM; 15 degrees C, 12:12 h L:D), fluctuating temperatures (FWM; 20 degrees C L: 10 degrees C D, 12:12 h L: D), and static cool temperatures (15 degrees C, 12:12 h L: D) followed by posteclosion chilling (CWM; 10 degrees C) under short-day (SD; 12:12 h L: D) or long-day photoperiods (LD; 16:8 h L: D). Live-captured D. suzukii WMs and CWMs had longer preoviposition times than newly eclosed summer morph adults, indicating a reproductive diapause that was not observed in SWMs or FWMs. Additionally, recovery after acute freeze stress was not different between CWM-SD females and live captured WM females. More 7-d-old CWMs survived 0, -1, or -3 degrees C freeze stress than summer morph adults, and more CWM-SD adults survived -3 degrees C freeze stress than CWM-LD adults.

We investigated if the geographic origin of cork oak influenced spring shoot phenology (timing of budburst) and if the variation among provenances (advances and/or delays) had consequences for leaf pest damage. The study was conducted in two provenance trials (planted in 1998) located in central and southern Portugal; each trial was surveyed during a two-year period. The variation in budburst timing was compared for 35 cork oak (Quercus suber L.) provenances sampled from the entire natural distribution of the species. Budburst exhibited high broad sense heritability (0.79-0.94). Two East/West groups effectively separated Q. suber genetic structure and the timing of budburst. Provenances from the western part of the natural range tended to burst later than provenances from the eastern part. Budburst provenance ranking was similar between sites and years. Climate strongly influenced budburst date: in the year with warmer winter months (2004), all provenances in both sites exhibited earlier budburst in comparison with 2003 and 2005. Leaf pest damage was assessed at the southern provenance trial. Differences in the timing of budburst had a significant effect on insect activity (herbivory), which was more concentrated in time and thus more important in the year with later budburst. However, North African provenances with earlier budburst were more exposed to insect herbivory within each year. This study demonstrated a significant provenance effect on budburst timing of Q. suber that is partly genetically determined and has consequences for exposure to herbivory. Knowledge of cork oak locally adapted provenances is important for sustainable forest management in Mediterranean climate conditions, particularly for (re)forestation actions, because it favors higher survival and growth.

Apple cider vinegar baited traps were used to monitor D. suzukii adults weekly, from April 2013 to July 2014, in 28 fields. Results show peak captures in the spring and fall seasons. In cherry orchards, adult trap counts were the highest near harvest (June) and declined thereafter, as fly populations moved to other crop (e.g., citrus) or non-crop habitats. The number of captured adults was positively related between pairs of sampled sites based on their proximity but was negatively related to differences in fruit ripening periods between different crops, suggesting that fly populations moved among crop and/or non-crop habitats during the year or had varying population dynamics on different crops and in different seasons. Mature egg load per female was higher during the fruiting season but lower during the winter season, with the majority of winter-captured females not containing mature eggs.

Insect feeding damage is visible on well-preserved fossil leaves, and changes in leaf damage through time can be compared to environmental changes. We measured percent leaf area damaged on four fossil leaf assemblages from the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, that range in age from 56.1 to 52.65 million years (Ma). We also include similar published data from three US sites 49.4 to similar to 45 Ma in our analyses. Regional climate was subtropical or warmer throughout this period, and the second oldest assemblage (56 Ma) was deposited during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a geologically abrupt global warming event caused by massive release of carbon into the atmosphere. Total and leaf-chewing damage are highest during the PETM, whether considering percent area damaged on the bulk flora, the average of individual host plants, or a single plant host that occurs at multiple sites. Another fossil assemblage in our study, the 52.65 Ma Fifteenmile Creek paleoflora, also lived during a period of globally high temperature and pCO(2), but does not have elevated herbivory. Comparison of these two sites, as well as regression analyses conducted on the entire dataset, demonstrates that, over long timescales, temperature and pCO(2) are uncorrelated with total insect consumption at the ecosystem level. Rather, the most important factor affecting herbivory is the relative abundance of plants with nitrogen-fixing symbionts. Legumes dominate the PETM site; their prevalence would have decreased nitrogen limitation across the ecosystem, buffering generalist herbivore populations against decreased leaf nutritional quality that commonly occurs at high pCO(2). We hypothesize that nitrogen concentration regulates the opposing effects of elevated temperature and CO2 on insect abundance and thereby total insect consumption, which has important implications for agricultural practices in today's world of steadily increasing pCO(2).",no,,,,,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2045-7758,NA,2016,10.1002/ece3.2203,WOS:000379344400008

However, little is known about the effects of snow cover and soil temperature on the overwintering pupae of H. armigera. A field experiment was conducted from November 2, 2012 to April 24, 2013 at the agrometeorological experimental station in Wulanwusu, China. Overwintering pupae were embedded into the soil at depths of 5, 10, and 15 cm in the following four treatments: without snow cover, snow cover, and increased temperatures from 600 and 1200 W infrared lights. The results showed that snow cover and rising temperatures could all markedly increase soil temperatures, which was helpful in improving the survival of the overwintering pupae of H. armigera. The mortality of overwintering pupae (MOP) at a depth of 15 cm was the highest, and the MOP at a depth of 5 cm followed. The lower accumulated temperature (a parts per thousand currency sign0 A degrees C) (AT a parts per thousand currency sign A degrees C) led to the higher MOP, and the lower diurnal soil temperature range (DSTR) likely led to the lower MOP. After snowmelt, the MOPs at the depths of 5 and 10 cm increased as the soil temperature increased, especially in April. The AT of the soil (a parts per thousand currency sign0 A degrees C) was the factor with the strongest effect on MOP. The soil moisture content was not a major factor affecting the MOP in this semiarid region because precipitation was 45 mm over the entire experimental period. With climate warming, the MOP will likely decrease, and the overwintering boundary air temperatures of H. armigera should be expanded due to higher soil temperatures and increased snow cover.",no,,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0020-7128,1432-1254,2016,10.1007/s00484-015-1090-y,WOS:000379262800005

Finally, we used the DD population model to examine hypothetical stage-specific mortality effects of IPM practices from insecticides and parasitoids at the field level. We found that adulticides applied during the early season will result in the largest comparative population decrease.

J,"Chasen, EM; Steffan, SA",Temperature-Mediated Growth Thresholds of Acrobasis vaccinii (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae),"Degree-day models link ambient temperature to the development of insects, making such models valuable tools in integrated pest management. These models increase management efficacy by quantifying and predicting pest phenology. In Wisconsin, the top insect pest of cranberry production is the cranberry fruitworm, Acrobasis vaccinii Riley (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Control of this species is often complicated by the fact that the larvae feed entirely within the fruit. Timing of control tactics, therefore, is critical and generally targets the adult and egg stages. However, the commencement of oviposition and egg hatch are extremely difficult to track empirically, forcing pest management strategies to rely on proxy events that are more apparent but less informative as indicators of cranberry fruitworm egg presence. This research provides the upper and lower temperature-mediated growth thresholds of this pest, which represents the first steps toward the creation of a degree-day model. Using field-collected A. vaccinii, we reared the larvae within cranberry fruit and monitored larval growth at nine different constant temperatures.

J,"Zidon, R; Tsueda, H; Morin, E; Morin, S",Projecting pest population dynamics under global warming: the combined effect of inter- and intra-annual variations,"The typical short generation length of insects makes their population dynamics highly sensitive not only to mean annual temperatures but also to their intra-annual variations. To consider the combined effect of both thermal factors under global warming, we propose a modeling framework that links general circulation models (GCMs) with a stochastic weather generator and population dynamics models to predict species population responses to inter-and intra-annual temperature changes. This framework was utilized to explore future changes in populations of Bemisia tabaci, an invasive insect pest-species that affects multiple agricultural systems in the Mediterranean region. We considered three locations representing different pest status and climatic conditions: Montpellier (France), Seville (Spain), and Beit-Jamal (Israel). We produced ensembles of local daily temperature realizations representing current and future (mid-21st century) climatic conditions under two emission scenarios for the three locations. Our simulations predicted a significant increase in the average number of annual generations and in population size, and a significant lengthening of the growing season in all three locations. A negative effect was found only in Seville for the summer season, where future temperatures lead to a reduction in population size. High variability in population size was observed between years with similar annual mean temperatures, suggesting a strong effect of intra-annual temperature variation. Critical periods were from late spring to late summer in Montpellier and from late winter to early summer in Seville and Beit-Jamal. Although our analysis suggested that earlier seasonal activity does not necessarily lead to increased populations load unless an additional generation is produced, it is highly likely that the insect will become a significant pest of open-fields at Mediterranean latitudes above 40 degrees during the next 50 years. Our simulations also implied that current predictions based on mean temperature anomalies are relatively conservative and it is better to apply stochastic tools to resolve complex responses to climate change while taking natural variability into account. In summary, we propose a modeling framework capable of determining distinct intra-annual temperature patterns leading to large or small population sizes, for pest risk assessment and management planning of both natural and agricultural ecosystems.",no,,,,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1051-0761,1939-5582,2016,10.1890/15-1045,WOS:000378092900018

The maximum observed fecundity of A. selenaria was 2,420 eggs per female at 19.4 degrees C, which decreased to ca 100 eggs per female at 34.3 degrees C.

J,"Silva, FWS; Elliot, SL","Temperature and population density: interactional effects of environmental factors on phenotypic plasticity, immune defenses, and disease resistance in an insect pest","Temperature and crowding are key environmental factors mediating the transmission and epizooty of infectious disease in ectotherm animals. The host physiology may be altered in a temperature-dependent manner and thus affects the pathogen development and course of diseases within an individual and host population, or the transmission rates (or infectivity) of pathogens shift linearly with the host population density. To our understanding, the knowledge of interactive and synergistic effects of temperature and population density on the host-pathogen system is limited. Here, we tested the interactional effects of these environmental factors on phenotypic plasticity, immune defenses, and disease resistance in the velvetbean caterpillar Anticarsia gemmatalis. Upon egg hatching, caterpillars were reared in thermostat-controlled chambers in a 2 9 4 factorial design: density (1 or 8 caterpillars/pot) and temperature (20, 24, 28, or 32 degrees C). Of the immune defenses assessed, encapsulation response was directly affected by none of the environmental factors; capsule melanization increased with temperature in both lone-and group-reared caterpillars, although the lone-reared ones presented the most evident response, and hemocyte numbers decreased with temperature regardless of the population density. Temperature, but not population density, affected considerably the time from inoculation to death of velvetbean caterpillar. Thus, velvetbean caterpillars succumbed to Anticarsia gemmatalis multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV) more quickly at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures. As hypothesized, temperature likely affected caterpillars' movement rates, and thus the contact between conspecifics, which in turn affected the phenotypic expression of group-reared caterpillars. Our results suggest that environmental factors, mainly temperature, strongly affect both the course of disease in velvetbean caterpillar population and its defenses against pathogens. As a soybean pest, velvetbean caterpillar may increase its damage on soybean fields under a scenario of global warming as caterpillars may reach the developmental resistance faster, and thus decrease their susceptibility to biological control by AgMNPV.",no,,,,,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2045-7758,NA,2016,10.1002/ece3.2158,WOS:000377043200018

We collected data on global changes (landscape and climate) and economic damage caused by six main insect pests during 1951-2010 in China. Landscape changes had significant effects on all six insect pests. Pest damage increased significantly with increasing arable land area in agricultural landscapes. However, climate changes had no effect on damage caused by pests, except for the rice leaf roller (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee) and armyworm (Mythimna separate (Walker)), which caused less damage to crops with increasing mean temperature. Our results indicate that there is slight evidence of possible offset effects of climate changes on the increasing damage from these two agricultural pests. Landscape changes have caused serious outbreaks of several species, which suggests the possibility of the use of landscape design for the control of pest populations through habitat rearrangement.

We used the invasive pentatomid, Halyomorpha halys, as the model organism because gaps in knowledge exist regarding its developmental physiology, it is expanding its global distribution, and it is of significant economic importance. Model predictions were compared against field observations over 3 years, and the parameter set that enables the largest population growth was applied to eight locations over 10 years, capturing the variation in temperature and photoperiod profiles of significant horticultural crop production that could be affected by H. halys in the US. As a species that overwinters as adults, critical photoperiod significantly impacted H. halys seasonality and population size through its influence on diapause termination and induction, and this may impact other insects with similar life-histories. Photoperiod and temperature interactions influenced life stage synchrony among years, resulting in an order of magnitude difference, for occurrence of key life stages. At all locations, there was a high degree of overlap among life stages and generation. Although all populations produced F-2 adults and thus could be characterized as bivoltine, the size and relative contribution of each generation to the total, or overwintering, adult population also varied dramatically. In about half of the years in two locations (Geneva, NY and Salem, OR), F-1 adults comprised half or more of the adult population at the end of the year. Yearly degree-day accumulation was a significant covariate influencing variation in population growth, and average maximum adult population size varied by 10-fold among locations. Average final population growth was positive (Asheville, NC, Homestead, FL, Davis, CA) or marginal (Geneva, NY, Bridgeton, NJ, Salem, OR, Riverside, CA), but was negative in one location (Wenatchee WA) due to cooler temperatures coupled with timing of vitellogenesis of F-2 adults.

However, the effect of shade on damage by the coffee berry borer (CBB) Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari), the most important coffee pest worldwide, is controversial and unclear. We compared infestation, total population per fruit and sex ratio of the CBB between shade and sun coffee, during two coffee-growing seasons in Adjuntas, Puerto Rico. According to generalized linear mixed models, CBB infestation was significantly higher in shade plots, and ranged from 7-52% compared with 4-26% in sun. However, the total population per fruit was higher in sun coffee fruits than in shade coffee, and the sex ratio was more biased to females in sun coffee. Sun coffee was characterized by higher temperatures and lower relative humidity. Environmental variables appeared to be important drivers of CBB population densities in field, with positive correlations between temperature and the number of pupae, juveniles, females and males. This tendency of larger populations in sun plots could represent a serious threat for coffee. In addition to fewer CBB in infested fruits in shade plots, we observed that shade coffee also had more natural enemies of CBB such as ants and entomopathogenic fungi. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It limits survival and affects all physiological and metabolic processes, including energy and nutrient procurement and processing, development and growth rates, locomotion ability and ultimately reproductive success. However, the influence of temperature on the energetic cost of development has not been thoroughly investigated. We show that in the diamondback moth [Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae)] rearing temperature (range10-30 degrees C) affected growth and development rates, the energetic cost of development and fecundity. Rearing at lower temperatures increased development times and slowed growth rate, but resulted in larger adult mass. Fecundity was lowest at 10 degrees C, highest at 15 degrees C and intermediate at temperatures of 20 degrees C and above. At a given rearing temperature fecundity was correlated with pupal mass and most eggs were laid on the first day of oviposition, there was no correlation between total eggs laid and adult longevity. The highest production cost was incurred at 10 degrees C; this decreased with increasing temperature, was minimized in the range 20-25 degrees C, and then increased again at 30 degrees C. These minimized production costs occurred at temperatures close to the intrinsic optimum temperature for this species and may reflect the rearing temperature for optimal fitness. Thus at sub-optimal temperatures greater food resources are required during the development period.

However the impact of fluctuating winter and spring conditions on the successful emergence of insects post-diapause is generally poorly known. Here we characterize diapause responses in the peach fruit moth (PFM) pest, Carposina sasakii Matsumura, which overwinters at the larval stage in soil. Temperatures at a depth of 5 cm fluctuated markedly in early spring during the critical PFM post-diapause period (late December to mid-April). By removing outdoor larval samples over this period, we show that the completion of diapause for PFM in northern China starts from late January and continues until March. This extended developmental period is accompanied by an ongoing loss of cold resistance. Temperature conditions experienced in the field were associated with cold tolerance and emergence times, and reduced cold tolerance was associated with shorter emergence time. Cryoprotectants declined from late December, and levels were associated with changes in the supercooling point (SCP) of the larvae, but both correlated weakly to survival under cold stress during the post-diapause period. These findings suggest that diapause stage and soil temperatures should be taken into account when predicting field dynamics of soil-dwelling overwintering insects based on degree day accumulation models and other approaches.

Larvae feed on roots (hence also called root grubs), causing reduced number of roots, loss of anchorage, stem tapering, reduced number of fronds, yellowing of leaves, yield reduction and death of the plants. The biology and ecology aspect of this scarabaeid are scanty. Hence, the aim of this study was to understand the ecological and behavioral aspects to develop IPM program. The adult emergence pattern of L. lepidophora was observed daily during the rainy season. The emergence period was defined between June and October during 2013 and 2014. Peak emergence of adult beetles occurred between 1900 and 2000 h. When raining occurred between 1800 and 2100 h, no emergence of adult beetles was observed. The sex ratio of L lepidophora varied over time, but the overall sex ratio was female biased in both the study years (female:male; 1:1.18 and 1:1.46 in 2013 and 2014, respectively). Males were found to emerge first in the season resulting in protandry. Innovative idea emerged during our field experiments in 2013-2014 was the use of female beetles for attracting male beetles. Female adults were collected and placed individually in traps made of small pouches of nylon net and were tied to the areca palm at a height of 5 ft. Trap containing a female beetle attracted male individuals for about 8-10 days. The same technique was employed for the large-scale collection of beetles during 2014. A total of 1843 males were collected in an areca grower's field using female-baited traps during 2014. Male baited traps did not attract female beetles, indicating existence of only female produced semiochemical that attracts males. Our findings provide new insights for incorporating adult collection using female-baited traps in IPM against areca nut white grubs.

This study investigated the life history of the litchi spider mite on wax apple (Syzygium samarangense Merr. & Perry) at five constant temperatures (16, 20, 25, 30, and 32 degrees C) under 70 +/- 5% RH and a 12L:12D photoperiod. Ninety-five percent of the eggs hatched at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, respectively. The entire developmental period was 40.3 days at 16 degrees C and only 93 days at 32 degrees C. The low developmental threshold temperature for development from egg to adult was 10.1 degrees C, and the effective accumulated temperature was 197.5 degree-days (DD). Unmated female mites had the longest life span although the oviposition period shortened as temperature increased. Mated female mites produced significantly more eggs than unmated females. At most, a mated female could produce an average of 3.5 eggs per day at 25 degrees C and a maximum of 60.3 eggs over, he entire oviposition period at 20 degrees C. Unmated females exclusively produce male offspring, indicating that litchi spider mites are arrhenotokous. At 25 degrees C, the intrinsic rate of increase (r) was 0.1610 day(-1), the net reproductive rate (R-0) was 19.58 offspring, the finite rate of increase (lambda) was 1.1747 day(-1), and the mean generation time (T) was 18.50 days.

The identification of season and time of day when leaf-cutting ants are most active is an important tool, not just to understand the foraging ecology of these ants, but also to optimize their control in plantation areas where they are pests. Thus, the aims of this study are to evaluate the daily foraging activity of leaf-cutting ant species of the genus Acromyrmex, which occur in forest plantations in Southern Brazil. Foraging activity of Acromyrmex crassispinus (Forel) and Acromyrmex subterraneus subterraneus (Forel) were correlated with weather conditions, and it was more intense during spring and summer. Workers that forage at night are significantly heavier than workers that forage during the day. This study showed that A. crassispinus and A. subterraneus subterraneus did not forage at temperatures below 10-11 degrees C. Then, the use of granulated baits to control these leaf-cutting ants species where they are pests should be done just under favorable conditions of temperature for Acromyrmex foraging activity (over 12 degrees C), to ensure maximum collection of baits by ants and the least left-over baits.",yes,field,damage,,,SOCIOBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0361-6525,NA,2016,10.13102/sociobiology.v63i1.902,WOS:000383994400004

The invasive agricultural insect pest Halyomorpha halys that causes severe economic losses in the United States is currently expanding both within United States and across Europe. We examined the drivers of H. halys invasion by characterizing the distribution and abundance patterns of H. halys and native stink bugs (Chinavia hilaris and Euschistus servus) across eight different spatial scales. We then quantified the interactive and individual influences of temperature, and measures of resource availability and distance from source populations, and their relevant spatial scales. We used Moran's Eigenvector Maps based on Gabriel graph framework to quantify spatial relationships among the soybean fields in mid-Atlantic Unites States surveyed for stink bugs. Findings Results from the multi-spatial scale, multivariate analyses showed that temperature and its interaction with resource availability and distance from source populations structures the patterns in H. halys at very broad spatial scale. H. halys abundance decreased with increasing average June temperature and distance from source population. H. halys were not recorded at fields with average June temperature higher than 23.5 degrees C. In parts with suitable climate, high H. halys abundance was positively associated with percentage developed open area and percentage deciduous forests at 250m scale. Broad scale patterns in native stink bugs were positively associated with increasing forest cover and, in contrast to the invasive H. halys, increasing mean July temperature. Our results identify the contrasting role of temperature in structuring regional patterns in H. halys and native stink bugs, while demonstrating its interaction with resource availability and distance from source populations for structuring H. halys patterns. Conclusion These results help predicting the pest potential of H. halys and vulnerability of agricultural systems at various regions, given the climatic conditions, and its interaction with resource availability and distance from source populations.

The noctuid stemborers, Busseola fusca and Sesamia calamistis and the crambid Chilo partellus attack maize in sub-Saharan Africa. They often occur as a community of interacting species in the same field and plant at all elevations. The influence of temperature on the intra-and interspecific interactions among larvae of these species, was studied using potted maize plants exposed to varying temperatures in a greenhouse and artificial stems kept at different constant temperatures (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) in an incubator. The experiments involved single-and multispecies infestation treatments. Survival and relative growth rates of each species were assessed. Both intra-and interspecific competitions were observed among all three species. Interspecific competition was stronger between the noctuids and the crambid than between the two noctuids. Temperature affected both survival and relative growth rates of the three species. Particularly at high temperatures, C. partellus was superior in interspecific interactions shown by higher larval survival and relative growth rates. In contrast, low temperatures favoured survival of B. fusca and S. calamistis but affected the relative growth rates of all three species. Survival and relative growth rates of B. fusca and S. calamistis in interspecific interactions did not differ significantly across temperatures.

The aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum (Olive), native to North America, was introduced into Japan in the late 1980s. A previous study revealed that, in Japan, the aphid population densities increased in spring, but they suddenly disappeared from low-elevation areas in midsummer (called summer disappearance). However, the aphids were found continuously in a mountainous area throughout the season. Field investigations and field and laboratory experiments were conducted to clarify the mechanism of such population dynamics. Although the number of aphids increased in spring, they rapidly decreased in lowland and mountainous areas in early summer. Both top-down and bottom-up effects seemed to contribute to the rapid decline because the density of predators peaked in the growing season and the host plant height reached 60-80cm, which suppressed the reproduction of aphids in our laboratory experiment. Then the aphids disappeared from lowland areas in midsummer when the maximum air temperature reached 35 degrees C there. The laboratory experiment revealed that the aphid does not survive at 35 degrees C. In addition, our field experiment in summer showed that U. nigrotuberculatum disappeared regardless of the presence or absence of an aphidophagous coccinellid, and the aphids did not disappear even on the tall plant treatment in the laboratory experiment. These results strongly suggest that high temperature in lowland areas causes the summer disappearance of U. nigrotuberculatum. Therefore, the population density of U. nigrotuberculatum is regulated by different factors between seasons and altitudes.",no,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0046-225X,1938-2936,2016,10.1093/ee/nvv173,WOS:000370271900003

Increase in temperature exhibited a negative effect on larval survival, larval period, pupal weights, and pupal period, but a positive effect on larval growth. Pupation and adult emergence were optimum at 25 degrees C. Elevated CO2 and temperature increased food consumption and metabolism of larvae by enhancing the activity of midgut proteases, carbohydrases (amylase and cellulase), and mitochondrial enzymes and therefore may cause more damage to crop production.

However, H. ligniperda survival by the end of the experiment was low on both diets when reared at 25 degrees C (10.1%, 95% CI: 5.2-15.1%), which suggests that rearing at lower temperatures may be required.

This perspective provides a straightforward path for interpreting the long-term population consequences of phenology change.

Long-term time series analysis of insect populations is crucial for analyzing the 'effect of climate change on plant-insect interactions in agro-ecological systems; yet such data are often lacking. Here, based on field experiments and the long-term time series of the overwintering adult cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) collected since 1975, we investigate the dynamic trend of H. armigera, as well as its driving forces and effects on the recruitment of H. armigera and crop yield. Results illustrated a shift to early eclosion of diapausing pupae due to global warming, extending the duration and abundance of adults in the overwintering generation. This then led to more larvae recruited in the first generation, and consequently damages the wheat at early growing stages. Our results suggest that the asynchronous effects of rising global surface temperature on the relative growth rate of spring crops and insect pests could intensify in the future, causing accentuated crop yield loss.

The physiological based model presented here is based on a stochastic demographic model for a stage-structured population that has application to a wide range of species across different taxa. The species life-history strategies are described in terms of a set of biodemographic rate functions dependent from the biological characteristics of the species and their environmental driver variables. Model application required parameter estimation of the biodemographic rate functions at two levels: assessing physiological responses at the per capita level and/or using population time series data for rate functions estimation. To explore the usefulness of the modelling framework in pest management, we consider the case study of the grape berry moth Lobesia botrana, a major pest in European vineyard. Most of the model parameters were estimated from data in the literature.

The population of X. compactus varied significantly across months and its major peak occurred from May to August. This variability was poorly explained by prevailing weather conditions with only the number of dead females correlated negatively with mean monthly temperature.

The ability of a pest species to colonize new areas depends on its ability to adjust the timing of phenological events in its life cycle, particularly at high latitudes where there is marked seasonality in temperature and day length. Here we incubated eggs of three species of geometrid moth, Epirrita autumnata, Operophtera brumata and Erannis defoliaria from different geographical populations (E. autumnata and O. brumata from Northern Finland, E. autumnata and E. defoliaria from Southern Finland and all three species from Germany) in a climate chamber at a constant temperature to determine the relative importance of geographic origin in the timing of egg hatch measured in terms of cumulative temperature sums (degree days above 5 degrees C, DD5); i.e. the relative importance of local adaptation versus phenotypic plasticity in the timing of egg hatch. In all three species, eggs from northern populations required a significantly lower temperature sum for hatching than eggs from southern populations, but the differences between them in temperature sum requirements varied considerably among species, with the differences being largest for the earliest hatching and northernmost species, E. autumnata, and smallest for the southern, late-hatching E. defoliaria. In addition, the difference in hatch timing between the E. autumnata eggs from Southern Finland and Germany was many times greater than the difference between the two Finnish populations of E. autumnata, despite the fact that the geographical distances between these populations is similar. We discuss how these differences in hatching time may be explained by the differences in hatch-budburst synchrony and its importance for different moth species and populations. We also briefly reflect on the significance of photoperiod, which is not affected by climate change. It is a controller that works parallel or in addition to temperature sum both for egg hatch in moths and bud burst of their host plants.",no,,,,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,1802-8829,2016,10.14411/eje.2016.043,WOS:000380706700040

In high- latitude environments it encounters strong evolutionary pressure to adapt to low temperatures due to high overwintering mortality and periodic influx of new individuals from more southern populations. Our study focused on gathering evidence for such a range shift leading to the formation of a permanent local population. The phenology and overwintering success of beetles was investigated from 2008 to 2015.

Over 700 degree days accumulated in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 exceeding the limit needed for development of two generations. However, food supply and temperature distribution in the growing period enabled development of the second complete generation only in 2010 and 2013. Survival of overwintering beetles in field conditions varied between 18% and 47% in the different years. Winter mortality was not associated with low air temperature in any year as snow cover provided the necessary protection and winter soil temperatures at the depth of 30 cm remained at around 0 degrees C for the duration of the whole observation period, with only some records as low as -3.5 degrees C. The survival of overwintering beetles is more likely defined by factors other than low temperature. As a result of periodic invasions of beetles with naturally lower cold resistance originating from southern regions, the structure of the overwintering population in Nordic temperate conditions is not homogeneous.

Association between changes in climate (temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity) and agricultural characteristics (wheat proportion, crop diversity, fertilizer input, and wheat yield per unit area) and damage from cereal aphids and armyworms were examined. Cereal aphid damage has been rising, while armyworm damage had no obvious trends, but with strong year-to-year fluctuations. The analysis indicates that the factors most strongly associated with the population dynamics of cereal aphids are fertilizer input and mean temperature in February, while the population dynamics of armyworms is significantly related to precipitation in May.

We investigated the development periods of N. aenescens egg, larva, pupa, and total immature insects at eight constant temperatures: 15.0 degrees C, 17.5 degrees C, 20.0 degrees C, 22.5 degrees C, 25.0 degrees C, 27.5 degrees C, 30.0 degrees C, and 32.5 degrees C. N. aenescens developed successfully from the egg stage to the adult stage at all the tested temperatures except 15.0 degrees C. The developmental time of each life stage was significantly influenced by temperatures. The developmental rate of N. aenescens increased as the temperature increased from 15.0 degrees C to 30.0 degrees C but declined at 32.5 degrees C, except in the pupa stage. The lower developmental threshold (LDT) and the thermal constant (K) was estimated using linear regression. The higher temperature threshold and the lower temperature threshold were calculated using two nonlinear functions. LDT and K from egg to adult emergence were 12.01 degrees C and 330.84 degree days, respectively. The temperature range of N. aenescens from the lower developmental threshold to the higher developmental threshold using a performance model (24.03) was wider than that determined using the Sharpe-Schoolfield-Ikemoto model (19.77). Developmental completion of N. aenescens was described using a two-parameter Weibull distribution model. Adult emergence frequency of N. aenescens over a full range of constant temperatures was simulated using developmental rate functions and the Weibull function. Biological characteristics of N. aenescens populations from different geographic areas were discussed.

Traps baited with aggregation pheromones are important management tools used to control this weevil. The daily flight activity patterns of the red palm weevil in Saudi Arabian date palm orchards were observed using smart traps (STs) with a catch period of 3 h (8 periods daily). Conventional bucket traps (CTs) were used for comparison. The capture efficiency of the STs was not significantly different from that of the CTs. A circular statistics analysis showed that the time of adult capture in the STs was nonrandom and indicated mainly diurnal activity; few adults were captured at night. The STs revealed differential activity between the sexes. The female activity pattern exhibited 2 strong peaks at 7 to 9 AM and 4 to 7 PM, and the 2nd peak was significantly higher than the 1st peak. The male activity pattern showed 3 peaks at 7 to 10 AM, 1 to 4 PM, and 4 to 7 PM with no significant differences among the peaks. Males initiated activity before the females. The number of adults captured by STs was positively correlated with the time of sunrise and wind velocity, negatively correlated with the time of sunset and the ambient temperature, and not significantly correlated with the relative humidity. Although these patterns were consistent during the study period, they differed from a variety of other patterns reported in European and Southern Asian environments, which suggests that R. ferrugineus has evolved considerable behavioral flexibility in coping with harsh environmental conditions typical of hot arid date production areas in Saudi Arabia.

Initial reports of the fly in new regions often are associated with damage in agriculture fields, but the fly may be present in the landscape for years before populations reach a level at which they become a pest in fruit production. In 2012, spotted wing drosophila was reported in blueberry fields in eastern Tennessee, USA, for the first time. In order to determine whether the fly was established in middle Tennessee, we conducted landscape surveys over 2 yr in the middle of the state's ornamental nursery industry where many fruit and ornamental hosts of the fly are grown. Red and yellow colored traps baited with yeast solution were placed in 17 locations of the 5-county nursery production region of middle Tennessee. Traps were monitored weekly for 8 wk in 2013 and 9 wk in 2014. Flies were caught at all 17 locations in 2013 and 16 of 17 locations in 2014. First activity was delayed 3 wk and total captures were 77% lower in 2014 relative to the previous year, likely due to high mortality of overwintering flies resulting from unusually cold winter temperatures in the region. No statistical differences were detected between trap colors in the landscape or between total captures of each sex, despite a trend for more female than male captures by the end of the season. Beginning Feb 2014, we also sampled weekly from a single yellow monitoring trap suspended within a plot of mixed-species dogwood trees (Cornus spp.;Caryophyllales: Cornaceae) for nearly 1 yr.

Rising winter temperatures from global warming can drive increases in outbreaks of some agricultural pests. In contrast, here we propose an alternative hypothesis that both extremely cold and warm winters can mismatch the timing between the eclosion of overwintering pests and the flowering of key host plants. As host plants normally need higher effective cumulative temperatures for flowering than insects need for eclosion, changes in flowering time will be less dramatic than changes in eclosion time, leading to a mismatch of phenology on either side of the optimal winter temperature. We term this the seesaw effect. Using a long-term dataset of the Old World cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in northern China, we tested this seesaw hypothesis by running a generalized additive model for the effects of the third generation moth in the preceding year, the winter air temperature, the number of winter days below a critical temperature and cumulative precipitation during winter on the demography of the overwintering moth. Results confirmed the existence of the seesaw effect of winter temperature change on overwintering populations. Pest management should therefore consider the indirect effect of changing crop phenology (whether due to greenhouse cultivation or to climate change) on pest outbreaks. As arthropods from mid- and high latitudes are actually living in a cooler thermal environment than their physiological optimum in contrast to species from lower latitudes, the effects of rising winter temperatures on the population dynamics of arthropods in the different latitudinal zones should be considered separately. The seesaw effect makes it more difficult to predict the average long-term population dynamics of insect pests at high latitudes due to the potential sharp changes in annual growth rates from fluctuating minimum winter temperatures.",no,,,,,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2045-7758,NA,2015,10.1002/ece3.1829,WOS:000367433000019

It overwinters as a diapausing fifth instar larva. The overwintering is often a critical part of the insect life-cycle in temperate zone. This study brings detailed analysis of seasonal changes in lipid composition and fluidity in overwintering larvae sampled in the field. Fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol (TG) depots in the fat body and relative proportions of phospholipid (PL) molecular species in biological membranes were analyzed. In addition, temperature of melting (T-m) in TG depots was assessed by using differential scanning calorimetry and the conformational order (fluidity) of PL membranes was analyzed by measuring the anisotropy of fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene probe in membrane vesicles. We observed a significant increase of relative proportion of linoleic acid (C18:2n6) at the expense of palmitic acid (C16:0) in TG depots during the larval transition to diapause accompanied with decreasing melting temperature of total lipids, which might increase the accessibility of depot fats for enzymatic breakdown during overwintering. The fluidity of membranes was maintained very high irrespective of developmental mode or seasonally changing acclimation status of larvae. The seasonal changes in PL composition were relatively small. We discuss these results in light of alternative survival strategies of codling moth larvae (supercooling vs. freezing), variability and low predictability of environmental conditions, and other cold tolerance mechanisms such as extending the supercooling capacity and massive accumulation of cryoprotective metabolites.

In this study, we examined the direct effects of three temperature regimes (16, 20 and 24 A degrees C) that reflect present and, potentially, future climate conditions on the response of Salix spp. plants, an important bioenergy crop, and its most damaging herbivore (Phratora vulgatissima) and an efficient natural enemy (the omnivorous predator Orthotylus marginalis). We found that plant growth, herbivore oviposition and enemy egg-foraging rate correlated positively with temperature. In the event of elevated temperatures following global climatic changes, these species could potentially respond in tandem. Still, the strength of responses varied among species, with herbivore and natural enemy exhibiting a similar and steeper rate of response relative to plants. Additionally, the herbivore's response was influenced by plant quality with altered oviposition rates depending on whether it was fed the (previously determined) resistant Salix dasyclados or susceptible S. viminalis. This indicates that host plant chemistry has the potential to mediate differential responses to temperature.

In Brazil, the pest is controlled by frequent pesticide sprays, leading to quick development of pesticide resistance in the pest, to high pesticide residue levels on the fruit and to decimation of natural enemies of this and other tomato pests. In order to develop biological control programs, basic information on the biology of the pest T. absoluta is essential. In addition, potential occurrence of resistance to the pest in tomato lines might be an interesting option for control of the pest, either alone or in combination with biological control. Therefore, we studied development, sex ratio, weight, fecundity and population growth of T. absoluta at constant (25 degrees C) and alternating temperature (30/20 degrees C) on two tomato lines (Bravo and Tex 317), which were expected to have different levels of resistance to the tomato borer. Tomato line and temperature regime significantly influenced many life history parameters. Development time was generally shorter and emergence rates higher on Bravo than on Tex 317. However, egg development time was similar on both tomato lines and temperature regimes, though egg survival was much lower on Tex 317. Also larval survival was lower on Tex 317, and this lower egg and larval survival suggests antibiosis resistance. Interestingly, the sex ratio was more female biased at the alternating than at the constant temperature on both tomato lines. Another temperature effect was a longer egg to adult development time on both lines at the alternating temperature regime. The net reproductive rate (R-0) and the intrinsic rate of population increase (rm) were higher on Bravo than on Tex 317, again indicating that Bravo is the most suitable host plant of the two. On the partially resistant tomato line Tex 317 population development is estimated to be much slower than on line Bravo. Also, T. absoluta larvae are exposed longer to natural enemies on Tex 317.

J,"Kim, DS; Lee, JH",Multi-modal oviposition model of overwintered Unaspis yanonensis (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) females and its field validation,"A multi-modal oviposition model of overwintered Unaspis yanonensis (Kuwana) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) was developed to predict the population of crawlers in citrus orchards for future incorporation into a population model of U. yanonensis. Three temperature-dependent components, namely, temperature-dependent total fecundity (TDF), age-specific cumulative oviposition rate (ACO), and age-specific survival rate (ASR) functions, were incorporated into the oviposition model. Overwintered U. yanonensis females showed cyclic oviposition activity. Thus, we assumed that the oviposition curve of U. yanonensis consisted of three independent oviposition cycles, and therefore estimated both TDF and ACO curves. The ASR curve, however, was not separated into three cycles. The chronological age of U. yanonensis was converted into a normalized age by the summation of pre-oviposition completion rates (1/pre-oviposition time in days). The estimated models of TDF, ACO, and ASR were successfully integrated to construct the multi-modal oviposition model. The model outputs accurately reflected the actual temporal abundances of U. yanonensis crawlers, displaying characteristic bimodality in the field. The peak time predictability of the model was largely robust The mean discrepancies were no more than 3 days in all cases as indicated by one-tailed one sample t-test. Also, the Chi-square test showed no significant difference between observed and predicted peak dates. Furthermore, the model showed high robustness, as the Pearson's correlation coefficients between actual observations and model outputs indicated significantly positive values and were mostly high values >0.80. Consequently, the developed oviposition model should be useful for timing control action targeting on the crawler population in citrus orchards.

Thus, even short-lived organisms are increasingly likely to experience periods of hot temperatures at some point of their life-cycle. Despite recent progress, it remains unclear how various temperature experiences during the life-cycle of organisms affect demographic traits. We simulated hot days (daily mean temperature of 30 A degrees C) increasingly experienced under field conditions and investigated how the timing and duration of such hot days during the life cycle of Plutella xylostella affects adult traits. We show that hot days experienced during some life stages (but not all) altered adult lifespan, fecundity, and oviposition patterns. Importantly, the effects of hot days were contingent on which stage was affected, and these stage-specific effects were not always additive. Thus, adults that experience different temporal patterns of hot periods (i.e., changes in timing and duration) during their life-cycle often had different demographic rates and reproductive patterns. These results indicate that we cannot predict the effects of current and future climate on natural populations by simply focusing on changes in the mean temperature.

In the greenhouse crop, male captures and leaf infestation were low in winter and increased steadily in spring up to 797.3 males/trap/week and 6.4 mines/leaf, respectively. Under open-field conditions, males were captured all year round with a peak in early September, concurrently with highest mean daily temperatures. Pest density in potato crops was very low (< 0.3 mines/leaf), as well as on S. nigrum (0.16 mines/leaf). Conversely, high pest infestation was observed in tomato leaves (3.8 mines/leaf) and fruits (27% damaged fruits). Eggs, larvae and adults were detected over two consecutive winters, indicating that T. absoluta can develop continuously over the year under natural conditions. Parasitoids were recorded throughout the survey at low rates (a parts per thousand currency sign16.1%).

Infested trees were felled as part of an eradication programme, but material that contained A. glabripennis life stages was retained and analyzed to provide information on the timing and length of the life cycle, as an aid to future management and surveillance. A total of 366 A. glabripennis larvae were recovered, including 69 first- and second-instar larvae found in June and July before any adults were found in the samples or had emerged, which indicated that the majority of eggs were laid in the previous autumn and over-wintered before hatching. Tree ring analysis and predictions of the timing of adult emergence based on degree-day accumulation also indicated that adults emerged late in the season, from August onwards, when lower temperatures would have caused most eggs to delay hatching until the next year. Two cohorts of older, established larvae were present in the samples, corresponding to larvae that had over-wintered once and twice, respectively.

A multi-model ensemble of regional climate change projections indicated shifts towards higher air temperatures and changing precipitation patterns during the summer and winter seasons up to the year 2100 for the region of Goettingen (Lower Saxony, Germany). A second major controlling factor of the agricultural production is the infestation level by pests. Based on long-term field surveys and meteorological observations, a calibration of an existing model describing the migration of the pest insect Ceutorhynchus napi was possible. To assess the impacts of climate on pests under projected changing environmental conditions, we combined the results of regional climate models with the phenological model to describe the crop invasion of this species. In order to reduce systematic differences between the output of the regional climate models and observational data sets, two different bias correction methods were applied: a linear correction for air temperature and a quantile mapping approach for precipitation.

The outbreaks of larvae are closely related to temperatures encountered by the immigrant adult. But mechanisms linking population outbreaks and migration are not well understood. We investigated the effect of exposing adults to constant temperatures from 14 to 34 degrees C on mating, oviposition, and longevity. Our results showed that both mating percentage and frequency were highest at 22-26 degrees C and decreased at temperatures outside this optimal range. Time of night when mating began was delayed at higher temperatures, while mating duration progressively decreased with increasing temperature. Both preoviposition period (POP) and oviposition period decreased linearly with increasing temperature. Peak daily and lifetime fecundity were highest at 22-26 degrees C and declined at temperatures outside this range, suggesting that 22-26 degrees C is the optimal thermal range for oviposition. Adult longevity was negatively correlated with temperature. Males lived longer than females at lower temperatures, but females lived longer than males in the 30-34 degrees C treatments. Together, our findings suggest that reproduction occurs when the prevailing temperature is around 22-26 degrees C, and that migratory flight is favored outside this range via increases in POP and proportion of virgins. We predict that larval damage or outbreaks of L. sticticalis will occur only in areas where the prevailing temperature is around 22-26 degrees C, which provides a key basis for the prediction of population outbreaks in areas of immigration.",yes,experimental,laboratory,fecundity,,JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,1536-2442,2015,10.1093/jisesa/iev135,WOS:000364309400004

To develop pest management programs for this pest, its seasonal abundance and distribution of immature stages (including teneral adults) in the soil were investigated. The seasonal abundance of D. abbreviatus adults was monitored with modified Tedders traps. Emergence of D. abbreviatus adults from soil pupation chambers occurred throughout most of the year, and peak emergence occurred from July to October. However, there was no secondary annual peak emergence over the 4 yr of study in California as has been observed in Florida, suggesting diaprepes root weevil is univoltine in southern California's cooler climate. Annual emergence cycles mirrored patterns of air temperature rather than rainfall. Seasonal abundance and the impact of climate on range expansion of diaprepes root weevil are discussed. The effect of the number and arrangement of traps on the number of adult D. abbreviatus caught was also investigated, and we determined that they did not have an effect on adult D. abbreviatus trap catch data.

However, dispersal biology of this invasive species is not well understood. This study evaluated the flight capacity and behavior of H. halys under laboratory, semi-field, and field conditions. Flight mills were used to measure the baseline flight capacity of adults collected year round from the field and included both foraging and overwintering populations. The effects of abiotic conditions such as wind speed and temperatures on the free flight parameters of H. halys were evaluated under semi-field and field conditions. The mean flight distances over a 22-h period were 2442 and 2083 m for male and female, respectively. Most individuals (89%) flew <5 km, though some flew much further with a maximum flight distance observed of 117 km. Flight distances by H. halys increased after emergence from overwintering sites in spring and reached their highest point in June. The incidence of take off by H. halys was significantly affected by the wind speed; when provided with still air conditions, 83% of individuals took off, but the rates decreased to <10% when wind speed was increased to or above 0.75 m s(-1). The incidence of take off by H. halys was significantly affected by ambient temperature and light intensity in the field, whereas relative humidity and insect sex did not.

To develop an effective control against DPS in arid regions, it is essential to know its bio-ecology including population dynamics and climatic factors influencing the duration and timing of life history and also the densities of different phenological stages (crawlers, first and second instars nymphs, adult males, and adult females). Monitoring of biological cycle and population dynamics of the pest were achieved through weekly counts of DPS densities on leaflets sampled at different position of date palm trees in an oasis of Ouargla region (Algerian Sahara Desert). Within this hyper-arid region, DPS established four generations per year, the most important was the spring generation. Two overlapping generations occurred in spring-early summer and two in autumn-early winter; these two pairs of generations were interspersed by two phases of high-mortality rates, the first corresponds to winter cold and the second refers to the extreme heat of summer. Statistical analysis of the effects of the studied climatic conditions (minimum, maximum and mean temperatures, precipitation, humidity, wind, rain days, and climatic indices) on the DPS densities at different phenological stages showed great variability from one stage to another.

A temperature-driven phenological model of codling moth, developed in Michigan, has been utilized in North Carolina and other states for decades. Systematic inaccuracy of this model in predicting moth emergence in North Carolina suggests that the relationship between emergence and temperature differs between the American midwest and southeast, or that additional factors may influence the system. RESULTSA method was developed to optimize the estimation of generation turnover intervals. Emergence was modeled as a function of heat unit accumulation. Significant differences between emergence predictions based on the resultant model and the existing model developed in Michigan were found. CONCLUSIONA new model of codling moth emergence, incorporating improved estimates for generation turnover for North Carolina, offers predictive improvement with practical importance to management. Differences between the emergence of susceptible and resistant moth populations were also investigated, leading to the suggestion that resistance to insecticides should be considered in future studies of emergence phenology.

Insect population models are mainly driven by environmental temperature data, which are usually collected from agrometeorological stations or derived from geographic statistical extrapolations. The present study describes the modeling of olive fly (Bactrocera oleae) populations in the Eastern Mediterranean region using the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Image Spectro Radiometer) land surface temperature (LST) product from NASA TERRA satellite. These data, together with in situ temperature data, were used to estimate the tree-canopy temperatures at the pixel resolution (1 km). The estimated canopy temperature was used as input for the olive fly population model. Our main aim was to demonstrate the use of satellite-acquired information for modelling biological and ecological phenomena. Eleven years (2001-2012) of olive fly population fluctuations were simulated for three different geographic locations, representing different geo-climatic conditions. The model successfully simulated the seasonal population fluctuations throughout the 11-year period and did a good job of connecting all of the life stages of the insect. To evaluate the validity of these findings, we compared them with adult olive-fly trapping data. We observed a high degree of correlation between the trapping data and our model's predictions. Here, we demonstrate that satellite thermal data can be used to predict insect pest population fluctuations for IPM purposes. The study also advances some new modelling concepts, such as the window of opportunity which links physiological development with chronological age. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The life cycle of X. glabratus was studied in avocado logs at 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 degrees C. Xyleborus glabratus successfully completed its life cycle at 24, 28, and 32 degrees C, with the greatest oviposition and development rate at 28 degrees C. Development of the egg and pupal stages was studied at 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 degrees C. One linear and 7 nonlinear developmental models were used to estimate the temperature-dependent development of both stages. The linear model estimated the lower threshold temperatures for egg and pupal development to be 13.8 degrees C and 11.1 degrees C, respectively, and the degree-days (DD) for egg and pupal development to be 55.1 DD and 68.2 DD, respectively. The Brier-2, Ratkowsky, Logan, and polynomial models gave the best estimates for the temperature-dependent development of the egg stages, whereas the Brier-1, Logan, and polynomial models gave the best estimates of temperature-dependent development of the pupal stages.

After having spread rapidly in the Mediterranean area since its first detection in 2006, it has recently become established in greenhouses in Western Europe. It was assumed that the low temperatures commonly associated with the winters in this area would prevent this exotic species from successful overwintering. However, the observed presence of T. absoluta at the start of the growing season in Belgium sparked a study on its potential to overwinter in Western Europe. In this study, the insect's cold hardiness and overwintering potential was assessed by determining: (1) the supercooling point (SCP) of larvae, pupae, and adults, (2) the lower lethal time (LT) for these stages at 0 and 5 A degrees C, and (3) the reproductive diapause incidence, as indicated by the reproductive performance of females reared at two temperatures (18 and 25 A degrees C) and two photoperiods [16:8 and 8:16 (L:D) h]. The mean SCP recorded for pupae (-16.7 A degrees C) was significantly higher than for adults (-17.8 A degrees C) and larvae (-18.2 A degrees C). Based on estimates of the LT adults demonstrated better cold hardiness than larvae and pupae at both 0 and 5 A degrees C with the median LT of adults averaging 17.9 and 27.2 days, respectively. No reproductive diapause was observed under the tested regimes.

Using 10 years of field data (2004-2013), we developed a forecasting model for C. bipunctata based on climate and density factors that can guide the minimum level of control required to prevent MWES. The multiple regression analysis selected both temperature and precipitation from the previous winter to summer and maximum C. bipunctata density in the previous August as determinant factors in the model for forecasting occurrence of C bipunctata in summer. This forecasting model could predict C bipunctata occurrence with an accuracy of <1 averaged standardized residuals, supporting the validity of the model. Economic levels of injury due to MWES in susceptible and tolerant (resistant) maize varieties were sustained at densities of 21 and 74 adults/m(2) respectively, derived from the results of suction and light trap monitoring of C bipunctata in the field. Combining these economic injury levels and the forecast from the model can guide choice of crops/varieties and seeding period in the coming summer to prevent MWES injury. This forecasting system is expected to be implemented in southwest Japan after consideration of the adaptability of the forecasting model to the entire target area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These viruses cause significant annual losses in winter wheat production throughout the western Great Plains. Temperature and humidity are factors that often influence arthropod survival, especially during dispersal from their hosts, yet the impact of these two factors on off-host survival has not been documented for wheat curl mite. Pathogen-infected host plants often influence the biology and behavior of vectors, yet it is not known if virus-infected wheat affects off-host survival of wheat curl mite. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine if temperature, relative humidity, and mite genotype impact off-host survival of wheat curl mite and 2) determine the effect of WSMV- and TriMV-infected host plants on off-host survival of wheat curl mite. Temperature and relative humidity significantly affected off-host survival of wheat curl mite. Length of survival decreased with increasing temperature (106.2 h at 10 degrees C and 17.0 h at 30 degrees C) and decreasing relative humidity (78.1 h at 95 and 21.3 h at 2%). Mites from TriMV-infected host plants had similar to 20% reduction in survival at 20 degrees C compared with those from WSMV-infected plants.

The current degree-day model for predicting a specified percentage of yearly moth flight involves heat unit accumulation above 10 degrees C after 1 May. However, because the moth's observed range has expanded into the northern and eastern United States, there is concern that suitable temperatures before May could allow for significant S. albicosta development. Daily blacklight moth catch and temperature data from four Nebraska locations were used to construct degree-day models using simple or sine-wave methods, starting dates between 1 January and 1 May, and lower (-5 to 15 degrees C) and upper (20 to 43.3 degrees C) developmental thresholds. Predicted dates of flight from these models were compared with observed flight dates using independent datasets to assess model performance. Model performance was assessed with the concordance correlation coefficient to concurrently evaluate precision and accuracy. The best model for predicting timing of S. albicosta flight used simple degree-day calculations beginning on 1 March, a 3.3 degrees C (38 degrees F) lower threshold, and a 23.9 degrees C (75 degrees F) upper threshold. The revised cumulative flight model indicated field scouting to estimate moth egg density at the time of 25% flight should begin when 1,432 degree-days (2,577 degree-days degrees F) have accumulated.

Neonate infestation and egg hatching were tested to evaluate the consequences of oviposition site selection. The percentage of eggs laid on the shady side of apple clusters was significantly higher than on the sunny side. How. ever, this was not influenced by leaf surface turning. Percentage of eggs on upper and lower leaf surfaces was significantly influenced by leaf surface turning.

Lacking an integrated pest management strategy, growers have resorted to an intensive chemical control program that may be leading to insecticide-resistant B. cockerelli populations in south Texas and Mexico. To initiate the development of an integrated approach of controlling B. cockerelli, we used constant temperature studies, nonlinear and linear modeling, and field sampling data to determine and validate the degree day parameters for development of B. cockerelli infesting potato. Degree day model predictions for three different B. cockerelli life stages were tested against data collected from pesticide-free plots. The model was most accurate at predicting egg-to-egg and nymphto-nymph peaks, with less accuracy in predicting adult-to-adult peaks. It is impractical to predict first occurrence of B. cockerelli in potato plantings as adults are present as soon cotyledons break through the soil. Therefore, we suggest integrating the degree day model into current B. cockerelli management practices using a two-phase method. Phase 1 occurs from potato planting through to the first peak in a B. cockerelli field population, which is managed using current practices.

The abundance of thrips on the sucker, the mother plant, and the bunch was significantly related to the abundance on neighbouring banana plants, and spatial autocorrelation indicated that E.brevisetis dispersed for only short distances. The number of thrips on the mother plant and on the bunch was positively related to the number of thrips on the sucker, suggesting that the thrips may disperse from the sucker to the mother plant and then to the bunch.

It has been hypothesized that cultivation under tunnels could increase the incidence of one of its major pests in many countries where strawberry is cultivated, including Norway and Brazil, the two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the use of tunnels on the incidence of T. urticae and on its natural enemies on strawberry in two ecologically contrasting regions, Norway (temperate) and southeastern Brazil (subtropical). In both countries, peak densities of T. urticae in tunnels and in the open fields were lower than economic thresholds reported in the literature. Factors determining that systematically seem to be the prevailing relatively low temperature in Norway and high relative humidity in both countries. The levels of occurrence in Norway and Brazil in 2010 were so low that regardless of any potential effect of the use of tunnel, no major differences were observed between the two cropping systems in relation to T. urticae densities. In 2009 in Norway and in 2011 in Brazil, increase in T. urticae population seemed to have been restrained mainly by rainfall in the open field and by predatory mites in the tunnels. Phytoseiids were the most numerous predatory mite group of natural occurrence on strawberry, and the prevalence was higher in Brazil, where the most abundant species on strawberry leaves were Neoseiulus anonymus and Phytoseiulus macropilis. In Norway, the most abundant naturally occurring phytoseiids on strawberry leaves were Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) rhenanus and Typhlodromus (Typhlodromus) pyri. Predatory mites were very rare in the litter samples collected in Norway. Infection rate of the pest by the fungus Neozygites floridana (Neozygitaceae) was low. The results of this work suggest that in Norway the use of tunnels might not affect the population densities of T. urticae on strawberry in years of lower temperatures. When temperature is not a limiting factor for the development of T. urticae in that country (apparently always the case in southern Brazil), strawberry cultivation in the tunnels may allow T. urticae to reach higher population levels than in open fields (because of the provided protection from the direct impact of rainfall), but natural enemies may prevent higher levels from being reached.",no,,,,,EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0168-8162,1572-9702,2015,10.1007/s10493-015-9913-4,WOS:000356881500004
J,"Joschinski, J; Hovestadt, T; Krauss, J",Coping with shorter days: do phenology shifts constrain aphid fitness?,"Climate change can alter the phenology of organisms. It may thus lead seasonal organisms to face different day lengths than in the past, and the fitness consequences of these changes are as yet unclear. To study such effects, we used the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum as a model organism, as it has obligately asexual clones which can be used to study day length effects without eliciting a seasonal response. We recorded life-history traits under short and long days, both with two realistic temperature cycles with means differing by 2 degrees C. In addition, we measured the population growth of aphids on their host plant Pisum sativum. We show that short days reduce fecundity and the length of the reproductive period of aphids. Nevertheless, this does not translate into differences at the population level because the observed fitness costs only become apparent late in the individual's life. As expected, warm temperature shortens the development time by 0.7 days/degrees C, leading to faster generation times. We found no interaction of temperature and day length. We conclude that day length changes cause only relatively mild costs, which may not decelerate the increase in pest status due to climate change.",no,,,,,PEERJ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2167-8359,NA,2015,10.7717/peerj.1103,WOS:000358691600006

Five pairs of male and female beetles were used for each combination of temperature and RH, and replicated ten times. The introduced adults were allowed to lay eggs for 72 h.

Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Spotted Wing Drosophila, SWD) is a pest that has been indicated as a major threat to European and Mediterranean fruit production. Its finding in Southern Italy offers interesting data to elaborate an efficient and sustainable control strategy. Materials and methods. The fly was collected during the overhead survey of an IAMB organic table grape vineyard by apple vinegar/wine/brown sugar bottle traps placed in and around the field. Once the presence of this pest was confirmed, traps were also hung on different host plants surrounding the vineyard, namely fig (Ficus carica L.), jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), wild bramble (Rubus fruticosus L.) and rough bindweed (Smilax aspera L.). Collected Drosophila adults were identified via morphological parameters by comparison with published descriptions and drawings. The SWD adult population was monitored per month throughout the year and related to the average values of the temperature (degrees C) and minimum relative humidity (mRH%). The survey was carried out from September 2012 to August 2013. Results and discussion. We report the finding of Drosophila suzukii in Southern Italy, Apulia Region, and its population dynamics throughout the year in the area. In addition to D. suzukii, D. melanogaster (Meigen), D. simulans (Sturtevant) and similar species were also scored. The D. suzukii dynamics appeared to be strictly correlated with the temperature and relative humidity changes throughout the year, with a great summer population decrease. This behaviour is quite different from that of other indigenous drosophilas, both pest and non-pest. Conclusion. D. suzukii has, at present, a prominent pest status and may represent a key pest of soft fruit orchards in the South-Eastern part of Italy and, namely, in Apulia. However, further investigation on the marked decrease in the SWD summer population is needed to support effective pest control strategies, which include baited-lure mass trapping in Mediterranean and other warm climate areas.

Present study thus aimed at simulating climatic change impacts on crop-pest interactions through a coupled crop-pest model. Based on temperature-dependent development of pink stem borer, Sesamia inferens (Walker) at six constant temperatures viz., 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 35 +/- 1 degrees C, thermal constants for eggs, larvae and pupae were determined as 47.6, 700 and 166.7 degrees days, respectively through a linear model with corresponding lower development thresholds being 13.8, 10.6 and 12.7 degrees C. Besides, optimum temperature and upper developmental threshold, respectively were found to be 34.6 and 36.2 degrees C for eggs, 34.5 and 36.4 degrees C for larvae, and 31.7 and 37.0 degrees C for pupae of the pink stem borer through a non-linear model. Based on the thermal requirements, and biotic and abiotic mortalities, a mechanistic holometabolous population simulation model for S. inferens was developed and coupled to InfoCrop-rice model. This coupled InfoCrop model could satisfactorily simulate the PSB dynamics and crop-pest interactions. Validated model was used to simulate the impacts of climatic change on S. inferens population and rice crop in accordance with four 'standard special report on emissions scenarios', A1, A2, B1 and B2. Simulations revealed that S. inferens population would decline to the extent of 5.82-22.8% by 2020 and 19.0-42.7% by 2050 under Delhi conditions. Following decline in pest population, S. inferens induced yield losses also revealed a declining trend under changed climate.

Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is one of the most serious insect pests in the world. Much is known about the survival of the overwintering population and spring emergence of H. armigera. However, little is known about the effects of climate change on overwintering and spring emergence of H. armigera. This study investigated the effects of changes of air and soil temperatures and precipitation on overwintering pupae of H. armigera by analyzing historical data from Magaiti County in northwest China using statistical methods. The results showed that during the period of 1989-2006, the climate warming advanced the first-appearance date of overwintering pupae eclosion (FD) and end date of overwintering pupae eclosion (ED) by 1.276 and 0.193 days per year, respectively; the duration between the FD and ED (DFEPE) was prolonged by 1.09 days per year, which resulted in more eclosion of overwintering pupae. For a 1 A degrees C increase in the maximum air temperature (T (max)) in winter, the FD became earlier by 3.234 days. Precipitation in winter delayed the FD and ED and produced little relative influence on DFEPE. A 1-mm increase of precipitation in winter delayed the FD and ED by 0.850 and 0.494 days, respectively. Mean air temperature (T (mean)) in March, with a 41.3 % relative influence, precipitation in winter, with a 49.0 % relative influence, and T (mean) in March, with a 37.5 % relative influence, were the major affecting factors on FD, ED, and DFEPE, respectively. T (max) in February with a 53.0 % relative influence was the major affecting factor on the mortality of overwintering pupae (MOP). Increased soil temperatures in October and November and autumn and air temperatures in winter could decrease the MOP, though the relative influences were lower than T (max) in February. Increased precipitation in winter increased the MOP, but the relative influence was only 4.2 % because of little precipitation. T (mean) in October had the greatest influence on the pre-wintering density of pupae (PDP). Increasing soil temperatures in October, November, and autumn increased PDP. A higher PDP increased overwintering survival and advanced FD and prolonged DFEPE. The overwintering boundary air temperatures of H. armigera should be expanded due to higher soil temperature and snow covering. Thus, climate warming helped to enhance the survival of overwintering pupae.",no,,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0020-7128,1432-1254,2015,10.1007/s00484-014-0903-8,WOS:000355336900009

Eggs failed to hatch and the newly-hatched nymphs could not normally develop at 10 degrees C. The developmental duration of egg and nymph decreased as temperature increased from 15 to 30 except 35 degrees C for egg. Based on the linear model, the lower developmental threshold and effective accumulated temperature were 10.68 degrees C and 150.2 DD for egg, and 12.08 degrees C and 208.3 DD for nymph, respectively. Among three non-linear models (Briere-1, Logan-6 and Lactin), Logan-6 provided the most accurate estimate for the mean optimum and lethal maximum temperatures (33.6 and 40.9 degrees C for egg, and 34.0 and 37.4 degrees C for nymphs). The interactive effects of three RH levels (45, 60 and 75%) and two temperatures (25 and 35 degrees C) on the immature developmental stages were tested. Temperature, RH and their interaction showed significant effects on egg and nymphal development.

Despite its well documented pest status, many aspects of the basic biology, including overwintering ecology, of L. hesperus are poorly understood. We examined the influence of eight constant temperatures from 10 to 35 degrees C on survival of nondiapausing adult L. hesperus held with or without food, and the consequences of exposure to an extended period at 10 degrees C on subsequent reproduction. Survival analyses indicated that, on average, fed insects tended to live longer than unfed insects, females lived longer than males, and the survival time decreased with increasing temperature. Nonlinear regressions indicated that median survival for insects grouped by gender and feeding status declined exponentially with increasing temperature. Survival functions for combinations of insect class (gender and feeding status) and temperature were adequately described by the respective two-parameter logistic functions. When adults were held for 9 d at 27 degrees C with food after a 33-d period at 10 degrees C either with or without food, no deleterious effects of prior starvation on propensity to mate or fecundity were demonstrated. These findings indicate that when temperatures are low, nondiapausing L. hesperus adults are capable of extended host-free survival with little or no impact on subsequent reproduction.

Blue wet sticky traps, direct sampling of trees (foliage, flowers, fruit), thrips exclusion experiments and weed sampling was carried out from 2007 to 2009 in nectarine and apple orchards, to determine which thrips species were present, when they occurred, what type of damage they caused and whether they occurred on orchard weeds. The native plague thrips (Thrips imaginis Bagnall) was the dominant species in all orchards from budburst, and the most abundant and widespread species during flowering in nectarines. Western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)) and onion thrips (Thrips tabaci (Lindeman)) were first detected at budburst in nectarines and apples, although they were not widespread and abundant until fruit development. Silvering was the most common type of thrips damage, primarily associated with F. occidentalis, though adult tomato thrips (Frankliniella schultzei (Trybom)), 7: imaginis, T. tabaci were also collected from silvered fruit. Both T imaginis and F. occidentalis caused scarring in nectarines, but only F. occidentalis caused pansy spot damage to apples in exclusion experiments. Frankliniella schutzei and T tabaci are regarded to be minor pests. Wireweed (Polygonum aviculare L., Plantaginaceae) and plantain (Plantago lanceolata L, Plantaginaceae) may be important summer hosts for adult F. occidentalis within the orchard, and temperature extremes may be limiting F. occidentalis populations.

They hatch during a short period only, making correct timing of control measures crucial. Swedish organic growers have requested a strategy for optimal timing of the Quassia amara (Simaroubaceae) extract against the apple sawfly. The aim of this study was, therefore, to develop methods to predict the timing of Q. amara control in Sweden. A temperature sum model for timely placement of monitoring or mass-trapping sticky traps was validated for Swedish conditions. The average emergence of sawflies occurred at 169 degree days (SD = 20) counted from March 15 (threshold temperature 4 A degrees C). The difference in emergence from existing first flight model of average and maximum 9 and 39 degree days (1 and 9 calendar days) was found acceptable. Accumulated oviposition of 85 % at full bloom (BBCH 65) suggests that mass trapping and monitoring could stop at this time. This is supported by a tendency of decreased trap catches during that period. Three application times for Q. amara were compared: (A) at petal fall (BBCH 67), (B) at a date calculated using female trap catch numbers and temperature sums, and (C) prior to peak egg hatch observed in the field. All treatments resulted in significantly lower percentage of damaged apples compared to the unsprayed control, with significantly less damage (1.3 %) in plots treated according to method (B).

Over the last few decades concerns have been raised about its invasiveness in those areas where it has been introduced. A test was carried out to investigate the ability of H. axyridis to survive, grow and reproduce at higher temperatures (30 degrees C) than the recorded optimum of 25 degrees C. In a preliminary experiment, the temperature of 35 degrees C was also tested, but was subsequently excluded, because all eggs were dehydrated. The eggs placed at 30 degrees C hatched, but at a considerably lower rate compared with the control eggs. This temperature resulted in faster larval and overall development compared with the control temperature. Adult weight and reproductive parameters were adversely affected at 30 degrees C. In particular, fecundity and fertility were dramatically lower for the females reared and maintained at 30 degrees C. The higher temperature tested had thus an overall negative impact on H. axyridis development and performance. A second experiment was designed to test the effects of a pyrethroid insecticide (lambda-Cyhalothrin) on H. axyridis in comparison with Adalia bipunctata (L.), a species commonly found in Europe. Larval mortality suggested that H. axyridis was less susceptible than A. bipunctata to lambda-Cyhalothrin.

We investigated the effects of experimental warming and grazing on the interaction between plants and the grassland caterpillar Gynaephora menyuanensis in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau in 2010 and 2011. Our results showed that grazing significantly increased nitrogen concentration in graminoids and sward openness with a lower sward height, sward coverage, and plant litter mass in the community. Grazing significantly increased G.menyuanensis body size and potential fecundity in 2010. The increases in female body size were about twofold greater than in males. In addition, grazing significantly increased G.menyuanensis density and its negative effects on aboveground biomass and graminoid coverage in 2011. We found that G.menyuanensis body size was significantly positively correlated with nitrogen concentration in graminoids but negatively correlated with plant litter mass. Even though warming did not significantly increased G.menyuanensis performance and the negative effects of G.menyuanensis on alpine meadow, the increases in G.menyuanensis growth rate and its negative effect on aboveground biomass under the warming with grazing treatment were significantly higher than those under the no warming with grazing treatment.

J,"Lehmann, P; Piiroinen, S; Lyytinen, A; Lindstroem, L",Responses in metabolic rate to changes in temperature in diapausing Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata from three European populations,"Many insects survive adverse periods in seasonal environments by entering diapause, a deep resting stage, during which energy consumption is typically low and gas exchange is in the form of a discontinuous gas exchange cycle (DGC). Because insects in high-latitude environments are severely time constrained during summer, an effective diapause termination with careful regulation of metabolic rate is important. The present study examines whether diapausing Colorado potato beetles Leptinotarsa decemlineataSay originating from three latitudinally different regions in Europe differ in their quantitative or qualitative gas exchange patterns in response to an increasing temperature. Overall production of gaseous CO2, as well as qualitative patterns relating to the DGC, are measured at a late stage of diapause at four different temperatures in increasing order from 13, 18, 23 to 28 degrees C. Overall CO2 production is found to be lower in the two northern populations (61 degrees 49N and 55 degrees 75N) compared with the southernmost population (45 degrees 48N) but increases as a function of temperature in all populations in a similar way. However, in the northern populations, raising the temperature increases the amount of CO2 discharged during single DGC peaks, whereas the DGC frequency remains relatively unchanged. By contrast, in the southernmost population, the amount of CO2 discharged during individual DGC peaks remains relatively unchanged, whereas the DGC frequency increases as a function of temperature. The observed differences may relate to water retention benefits or, alternatively, energetic benefits relating to heightened gas exchange efficiency in hypoxic or hypercapnic environments. Overall, the results suggest that, although populations of L. decemlineata may have similar thermal sensitivities, they have different qualitative strategies to regulate metabolic re-activation at diapause termination.",no,,,,,PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0307-6962,1365-3032,2015,10.1111/phen.12095,WOS:000354131800003

However, recent progress on greenhouse microclimate characterisation has highlighted the strong indoor climate heterogeneity that may influence the within-crop pest distribution. In this study, both microclimate (air temperature and humidity) and thrips distribution were simultaneously mapped in a rose greenhouse. The measurements were sensed in a horizontal plane situated at mid-height of the rose crop inside the greenhouse. Simultaneously, thrips population dynamics were assessed after an artificial and homogeneous infestation of the rose crop. The spatio-temporal distribution of climate and thrips within the greenhouse were compared, and links between thrips infestation and climatic conditions were investigated. A statistical model was used to define the favourable climate conditions for thrips adults and larvae. Our results showed that (i) the air temperature and air humidity were very heterogeneously distributed within the crop, (ii) pest populations aggregated in the most favourable climatic areas and (iii) the highest population density of thrips adults and larvae were recorded at 27 degrees C and 22 degrees C for temperature and 63% and 86% for humidity, respectively.

Heat exposure at the 1st-instar or egg stage did not influence subsequent maturation success, while exposure at the 3rd-instar larval stage did have an effect.

Despite recent advancements, we still lack a detailed understanding of how changes in the frequency and amplitude of extreme climate events are linked to the temporal and spatial structure of natural communities. To answer this question, we used a combination of laboratory experiments, field experiments, and analysis of multi-year field observations to reveal the effects of extreme high temperature events on the demographic rates and relative dominance of three co-occurrence aphid species which differ in their transmission efficiency of different agricultural pathogens. We then linked the geographical shift in their relative dominance to frequent extreme high temperatures through a meta-analysis. We found that both frequency and amplitude of extreme high temperatures altered demographic rates of species. However, these effects were species-specific. Increasing the frequency and amplitude of extreme temperature events altered which species had the highest fitness. Importantly, this change in relative fitness of species was consistent with significant changes in the relative dominance of species in natural communities in a 1year long field heating experiment and 6year long field survey of natural populations. Finally, at a global spatial scale, we found the same relationship between relative abundance of species and frequency of extreme temperatures. Together, our results indicate that changes in frequency and amplitude of extreme high temperatures can alter the temporal and spatial structure of natural communities, and that these changes are driven by asymmetric effects of high temperatures on the demographic rates and fitness of species.

Traps were georeferenced and catches were analyzed by geostatistical maps. Each year, the percentage of damaged tubers at harvest was assessed. Pheromone trapping, integrated with temperature-dependent developmental times, showed that PTW completed two generations throughout the potato-growing season; the remaining generations developed in the noncrop season. Maps showed a clumped distribution of PTW at the landscape scale. The hot spots of infestation corresponded to the areas most intensively cropped with potato.

In recent years, conifers in the northern hemisphere have experienced increased bark beetle damage, particularly at the limits of their distribution. In this project, we investigated bark beetle populations and insect damage in Pinus trees along an altitudinal gradient in order to obtain an overview of damage at regional level, and also to analyze the consequences of rising temperatures on insect damage in trees. The study was conducted in the communal pine forests of Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. In September 2011, 32 Lindgren traps were hung along an altitudinal gradient from 2200 to 2750 m a.s.l., with traps set at 150-200 m intervals of altitudinal difference. In each trap, alpha-Pinene and turpentine were added as bark beetle attractants. Every three weeks over a study period of one year, the captured insects were collected and identified in the laboratory. Abiotic site conditions (temperature and humidity) were also measured at each altitude hourly. During the dry season, phytosanitary characterization was conducted at each site. Throughout the study, 19 Scolytinae bark beetle species were recorded, all of which were considered to be non-aggressive pests. Bark beetles showed higher species richness and abundance at the lowest altitude (2200 m a.s.l.), particularly on the early collection dates, compared to other altitudes (2400, 2600 and 2750 m a.s.l.; p < 0.05). Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and lowest humidity were higher at low altitudes while maximum humidity was higher at high altitudes. There was a significant positive relationship between maximum temperature and bark beetle abundance. Pines with bark beetles damage were more abundant at 2200 m a.s.l. with Pinus pseudostrobus identified as the most damaged tree species.

The development period for immature stages of the fennel aphid Hyadaphis foeniculi (Passerini) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) at constant temperatures was modelled in order to determine mathematical functions for simulating the aphid's development. Non-linear models were used to describe the relationship between temperature and development rates of H. foeniculi subjected to constant temperatures. RESULTSThe models used were found to be good fits for estimating H. foeniculi development rates as a function of temperature, with the exception of the Davidson model. The development time of H. foeniculi nymphs ranged from 2.73days (first instar) to 6.18days (fourth instar) at 15 degrees C, from 2.57days (first instar) to 4.52days (fourth instar) at 20 degrees C and from 1.53days (first instar) to 2.05days (fourth instar) at 28 degrees C. CONCLUSIONThese models provide important tools for better elucidation of the relationship between temperature and development rates in H. foeniculi. The results could be used for predicting the occurrence of the various immature stages of H. foeniculi in the fennel crop in Brazil, making it possible to predict more accurately the best periods for implementing pest control.

In contrast to majority of the other studied species of shrubs, sunlit leaves are grazed to a much greater extent than shaded leaves. Since the observation of a link between leaf irradiance level and A. brevicollis feeding is unique, we hypothesized that feeding preference of this beetle species is related to the speed needed to escape threats i.e. faster jumping. We also hypothesized that sunlit leaves are more nutritious and easier to consume than the leaves of shaded shrubs. Results indicated that beetle mass was greater in beetles occupying sunlit leaves, which is consistent with our second hypothesis. The study also confirmed under laboratory conditions, that larvae, pupae and beetles that were fed full-light (100% of full light) leaves were significantly heavier than those fed with shaded leaves (15% of full light). In the high irradiance conditions (higher temperature) duration of larval development is also reduced. Further results indicated that neither the concentration of soluble phenols, leaf toughness, or the number of trichomes could explain the insect's preference for sunlit leaves. Notably, measurements of jump length of beetles of this species, both in the field and under laboratory conditions, indicated that the defense pattern related to jumping was associated with light conditions. The jump length of beetles in the sun was significantly higher than in the shade. Additionally, in laboratory tests, beetle defense (jumping) was more strongly affected by temperature (15, 25, or 35 degrees C for 24h) than by leaf type. The effect of sunlit, higher nutrient leaves (greater level of non-structural carbohydrates) on defense (jumping) appears to be indirect, having a positive effect on insect mass in all developmental stages.",no,,,,,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1932-6203,NA,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0126072,WOS:000353713100126

Understanding the relationship between temperature variations and the population growth rates of H. foeniculi is essential to predict the population dynamics of this aphid in the fennel crop. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of constant temperature on the adult prereproductive period and the life table fertility parameters (infinitesimal increase ratio (r(m)), gross reproduction rate (GRR), net reproduction rate (R-0), finite increase ratio (lambda), generation time (GT), the time required for the population to double in the number of individuals (DT), and the reproduction value (RVx)) of the fennel pest H. foeniculi. The values of lx (survival of nymphs at age x) increased as the temperature rose from 15 to 28 degrees C and fell at 30 degrees C, whereas mx (number of nymphs produced by each nymph of age x) increased from 15 to 25 degrees C and fell at 28 and 30 degrees C. The net reproduction rates (R-0) of populations of H. foeniculi increased with temperature and ranged from 1.9 at 15 degrees C to 12.23 at 28 degrees C for each generation. The highest population increase occurred with the apterous aphids at 28 degrees C. The rate of population increase per unit time (r(m)) (day) ranged from 0.0033 (15 degrees C) to 0.1995 (28 degrees C). The highest values of r(m) were recorded at temperatures of 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The rm values were a good fit to the models tested, with R-2 > 0.91 and R-adj(2) > 0.88. The models tested (Davidson, Sharpe and DeMichele modified by Schoolfield et al., Logan et al., Lamb, and Briere et al.) were very good fits for the rm values observed, with R-2 > 0.91 and R-adj(2) > 0.88. The only exception was the Davidson model. Of the parameters studied, the reproductive capacity was higher in the apterous aphids, with the unique exception of daily fecundity at 28 degrees C, which was higher in the alate aphids of H. foeniculi. Parameters relating to the age-specific fertility table for H. foeniculi were heavily influenced by temperature, with the highest biotic potential and population growth capacity found at 34 degrees C.

However, diurnal varying temperature regimes more commonly represent the environment in which most organisms thrive. Such varying temperature regimes have been demonstrated to substantially affect development and reproduction of ectothermic organisms, generally in accordance with Jensen's inequality. In the present study we evaluated the impact of temperature alternations at 4 amplitudes (DTR0, +5, +10 and + 15 degrees C) on the developmental rate of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and their natural prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). We have modelled their developmental rates as a function of temperature using both linear and nonlinear models. Diurnally alternating temperatures resulted in a faster development in the lower temperature range as compared to their corresponding mean constant temperatures, whereas the opposite was observed in the higher temperature range. Our results indicate that Jensen's inequality does not suffice to fully explain the differences in developmental rates at constant and alternating temperatures, suggesting additional physiological responses play a role. It is concluded that diurnal temperature range should not be ignored and should be incorporated in predictive models on the phenology of arthropod pests and their natural enemies and their performance in biological control programmes.",no,,,,,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1932-6203,NA,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0124898,WOS:000353015800154

Because temperature dictates insect growth rate, development can be accurately estimated based on daily temperature measurements. To better predict S. sulfureana development across the growing season, we investigated the temperature range within which S. sulfureana larvae can feed and grow. Larvae were reared at 13 constant temperatures ranging from 6.5-38.6 degrees C. Larval growth rate was determined by the rate of change of larval weight across time. The respective growth rates among these temperatures were modeled using simple linear, cubic, and Lactin nonlinear development functions. These models isolated the lower temperature threshold at which growth became nonzero and the upper temperature at which growth was maximized. All three models were significantly predictive of S. sulfureana growth, but the cubic model best represented the observed growth rates, effectively isolating lower and upper thresholds of 9.97 and 29.89 degrees C, respectively.

The environmental factors affecting its flight activity and dispersal were analyzed. Among the climatic variables, temperature had a positive impact on T.vaporariorum flight, whereas relative humidity had only a weak effect. More flights were made during the morning and afternoon, with fewer flights occurring when the temperature was above 25 degrees C in greenhouses containing zucchini or above 30 degrees C in those containing tomato; no flights were recorded when the temperature was 12.30 degrees C in either setting. Flight typology, classified as short, long or dispersal, and covering a few centimeters to more than 2-3m, was influenced by the vegetative condition of the plants. As the plants aged and declined in condition, the number of short flights decreased, whereas the number of long and dispersal flights increased. Based on these results, we can conclude that the dispersal of T.vaporariorum in greenhouses containing either tomato or zucchini crops is generally influenced by environmental factors, which also affect the type of flight, with a trade-off between short and long dispersal flights. However, adult dispersal is driven not only by temperature, but also by other factors, such as conspecific density and time of the day. Therefore, producers must consider such factors when aiming to reduce the dispersal of pest insects within greenhouses and, thus, to maintain the productivity of their crops.",no,,,,,ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1343-8786,1479-8298,2015,10.1111/ens.12097,WOS:000352625500008

J,"Brimblecombe, P; Brimblecombe, CT",Trends in insect catch at historic properties,"Warmer climate has the potential to increase the number of insect pests in historic properties. This possibility has been explored using the catch from some thirty thousand insect traps laid out in English Heritage properties over more than a decade. The trapping programme resulted from an increasing focus on integrated pest management (IPM). Trapping has been more frequent in London and the Southeast. Quarterly inspection and replacement has led to a detailed record of catch. Although these data were collected for management purposes, they offer the potential to assess the impact of environmental change. Variation in the number of traps placed out requires data to be expressed as catch rate (insects caught per trap). The record suggests an increase in the average catch of booklice (Liposcelis bostrychophila) summed across all the properties examined over the period 2000-2012. There was a striking increase in the prevalence of the webbing clothes moth (Tinea pellionella) even when accounting for the increasing use of attractant pheromones in traps. In addition, infestations (i.e. >10 insects per trap) also seemed to increase. However, these increases over time are not likely to be attributable to increasing temperatures. Nevertheless, the catch rate for woolly bear larvae (Anthrenus spp.) at the London properties showed a weak correlation with temperature in the warmer seasons. If temperature were to increase across the 21st century, a dramatic increase in catch rate would be expected. However, it is hardly likely as the abundance of insects is not driven by temperature alone. Other factors such as: food, habitat, access points, housekeeping and indoor climate can all have an impact on insect numbers and on infestations within a property. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

For developing population models to better understand this key pest, survival rates need to be known. In contrast to the reported field survival of eggs, the three larval instars, and pupae, the survival of the adults had not been assessed under field conditions. Weekly survival of adults was studied in large walk-in gauze cages in two fields in Hungary between 2009 and 2011. Each cage contained a combination of maize with two out of nine other crops. The number of adult beetles rapidly decreased with time following an exponential-like survivorship curve, with a weekly mortality varying between 31 and 61 %. This is in contrast to laboratory experiments, where populations decreased with time following a linear-like curve. The average lifespan was only 19 days with a maximum of 84 days. After 14 days, 55 % of adults had died, thus, having had no chance to lay eggs because of the pre-oviposition period required. Maize appeared to be the most appropriate crop for survival. Combining maize with other crops that could serve as alternative food did not enhance survivorship, and many combinations were in fact disadvantageous. Crop and weed coverage played a minor role in influencing survival, and only few weeds appeared slightly advantageous. It is argued that the role of alternative food sources for D. v. virgifera adults might be overestimated.

Specifically, we examined generational, sexual, and phenotypical effects on flight distance, frequency, velocity, and diel flight patterns of field-collected H. halys from two seasons. There was a clear dichotomy in total flight distance for insects that flew 5 km or less and those that flew more than 5 km in 24 h.

Risk prediction advice has relied upon flight temperature thresholds, while risk assessment uses simple economic thresholds. However, there is variation in the reported temperature of migration, and economic thresholds vary widely across Europe, probably owing to climatic factors interacting with beetle activity and plant compensation for damage. The effect of temperature on flight, feeding and oviposition activity of M. aeneus was examined in controlled conditions. RESULTSEscape from a release vial was taken as evidence of flight and was supported by video observations. The propensity to fly followed a sigmoid temperature-response curve between 6 and 23 degrees C; the 10, 25 and 50% flight temperature thresholds were 12.0-12.5 degrees C, 13.6-14.2 degrees C and 15.5-16.2 degrees C, respectively. Thresholds were slightly higher in the second of two flight bioassays, suggesting an effect of beetle age. Strong positive relationships were found between temperature (6-20 degrees C) and the rates of feeding and oviposition on flower buds of oilseed rape. CONCLUSIONThese temperature relationships could be used to improve M. aeneus migration risk assessment, refine weather-based decision support systems and modulate damage thresholds according to rates of bud damage.

Although capture heights decreased with greater minimum relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and increased with greater mean wind speed, the contributions of these factors were determined to be minor relative to that of mean temperature.

A thorough understanding of pest biology is essential for development of a reliable pest population prediction system and management strategies, but little is known about this pest. Therefore, we quantified the development, fecundity, fertility, longevity, morphometrics (length, width, and hind tibia length of adults), and other life table parameters of L.invasa in relation to temperature and to provide an experimental basis for developing an overall wasp population model. The results showed that ranging from 20 to 32 degrees C (five constant temperatures were 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C, respectively), the developmental period of immatures (egg to adult) was shortest at 29 degrees C but longest at 20 degrees C; the number of eggs per female in the oviduct and survival rate of immatures were greatest at 29 degrees C but smallest at 32 degrees C. The effect of temperature on morphometrics was more pronounced for females than males. When L.invasa was fed with a 40% honey solution, maximum longevity was at 23 degrees C (9.0 days for females and 12.8 days for males). The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) was largest (0.0477) at 29 degrees C, and the sex ratio of L.invasa was extremely female-biased. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) indicates that L.invasa population growth is likely to be greatest at 29 degrees C. The developmental zero temperature (t) and the effective cumulative temperature (k) of egg, larva and pupa were 13.0, 19.7 and 17.1 degrees C, and 128.1, 284.2 and 201.2 degrees C, respectively. For L.invasa, 19.1 degrees C (t) and 563.5 degrees C (k) were indispensable for completing development from egg to adult.

S,"Roik, K; Wielkopolan, B; Kubsik, K",Monitoring and control possibilities of leaf miners (Agromyzidae) in winter wheat in Poland,"Nowadays the higher occurrence of cereal insects is observed. Until recently it has been considered to be of little economic relevance. Today cereal insects develop better, thanks to the climate warming, simplification of agricultural techniques and extensive farming in large areas. One of the most pervasive species is leaf miners from the Agromyzidae family, which larvae feed on inner side of the cereal leaves. In Poland there is more than a dozen species of leaf miners (Walczak 1995). They may occur locally in large numbers, and cause substantial damage to the crops which reduce quality and quantity of the harvest. Larvae of the leaf miner feed on the parenchyma, causing damages (so-called mines). Effective methodology of fighting the insects with chemical means have not been developed yet. Studies of integrated methods of cereals protection carried out so far, have shown that a good practical method of chemical signaling is to control the number of adults trapped on yellow traps. Monitoring of cereal leaf miner flights in winter wheat was carried out in Slupia Wielka and Baborowko (Greater Poland Voivodeship) in the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 growing seasons. Yellow traps were placed above the tops of wheat during vegetation period. The number of damaged wheat stems was recorded. Fluctuations in weather conditions during the research affected the dynamics of leaf miner flies considerably.

Thereafter, intensive research was conducted to develop pest control methods in table olives grown for canned fruit. The life history of olive fruit fly was elucidated, and the distribution and abundance of the adults determined through trapping programs. Olive samples from noncommercial trees were collected from 2002 through 2013 in different locations to determine the maximum number of larvae per fruit. Larvae were most abundant in September and October and ranged from <0.5 to 10 per fruit. The date of maximum fruit infestations may differ annually due to the amount of fruit set, fruit size, and weather. Very high numbers of larvae were collected from large green fruit (>= 4 g), whereas smaller fruit (similar to 2-3 g) supported fewer insects. High larval numbers were found in fruit from areas with cooler summer weather than in fruit from the hot inland valleys. Olive fruit fly larval populations were prevalent in locations with high summer temperatures when buffered by cool marine air flow or slightly higher elevations from the inland valley floor. High larval infestations were found at an arid location with hot summers, suggesting that olive fruit fly may adapt to such conditions. Infested fruit was collected from the same locations in subsequent years, and the proximity of commercial olive orchards may enhance susceptibility to future infestation. Control methods are summarized, including intensive biological control programs and new techniques such as bait stations considered for pest management programs. Basic cultural practices such as removal of nonharvested fruit that support multiple generations, timing of harvest to avoid adult activity, and elimination of standing water required by olive fruit fly adults for survival would be of major importance in reducing pest populations.",yes,field,abundance,,,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2155-7470,NA,2015,10.1093/jipm/pmv014,WOS:000367251500014

The model was designed to calculate the population index or relative population using hourly weather data as influenced by developmental rate, high and low temperature mortalities and wet soil moisture mortality. Each module contains biological parameters derived from controlled experiments. The hourly weather data used for the model inputs were obtained from the National Center of Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP-CFSR) at a 38 km spatial resolution. A combination of spatial and site-specific temporal data was used to validate the GPFS models. The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), was selected as a case study for this research because it is climatically driven and a major pest of fruit production. Results from the GPFS model were compared with field B. dorsalis survey data in three locations: 1) Bangalore, India; 2) Hawaii, USA; and 3) Wuhan, China. The GPFS captured the initial outbreaks and major population peaks of B. dorsalis reasonably well, although agreement varied between sites. An index of agreement test indicated that GPFS model simulations matched with field B. dorsalis observation data with a range between 0.50 and 0.94 (1.0 as a perfect match). Of the three locations, Wuhan showed the highest match between the observed and simulated B. dorsalis populations, with indices of agreement of 0.85. The site-specific temporal comparisons implied that the GPFS model is informative for prediction of relative abundance. Spatial results from the GPFS model were also compared with 161 published observations of B. dorsalis distribution, mostly from East Asia.

In 2007-2013, entomological study has been carried out under different cultural soil crop management practices: classical (by ploughing) and conservative no tillage (successive no ploughing), in open field agro-ecosystems and in agro-forestry belts farming system. Major outbreaks of abundance of thrips (Haplothrips tritici); wheat flies (Chloropidae: Oscinella frit, Meromyza nigriventris, Elachiptera cornuta etc. and Anthomyiidae: Delia coarctata, Phorbia securis, Ph. penicillifera); stem flea beetles (Chaetocnema aridula); leafhoppers (Javesella pellucida, Psammotettix alienus, Macrosteles laevis), aphids (Sitobion avenae, Schizaphis graminum, Rhopalosiphum padi, Metopolophium dirhodum); bugs (Eurygaster maura, Aelia acuminata), etc. were observed. The paper mentions the importance of adjusting the technology of IPM to the structural changes of harmful entomofauna, which is highlighted, in relation to climatic warming and increased aridity, by higher abundance of wheat thrips (as eudominant species), of Chloropidae wheat flies, leafhoppers, aphids, wheat fleas (as dominant groups), cereals bugs, etc. IPM recommends special attention to preventing measures for zone specific pests which still show a high biological potential: cereal flies, leafhoppers, aphids, etc., by respecting the optimal sowing time, agro-technical methods, seed treatment with systemic insecticides and complex plant protection measures. Due to increased aridity and climate warming, the critical attack moments were recorded 3-4 weeks earlier and overlapped. The research results proved the importance of insecticide applications at two different moments: at the end of tillering phase and at ear emergence, in open field area. At the first treatment, the pest groups that focus on spring crops (cereal flies, fleas, leafhoppers, thrips, bugs, etc.) are controlled simultaneously, by recommending the shock and systemic insecticides (pyrethroids, neonicotinoid, etc.), no later than the herbicides are applied. At the second treatment, the ear pests (thrips, aphids, bugs, etc.) are controlled simultaneously and shock insecticides (pyrethroids etc.) with a low negative effect on the entomophag arthropod fauna, are strongly recommeded. The IPM is a major section of successive soil no tillage technologies, comprising a special pest control strategy, with insecticides application as seed treatment and in 2-3 successive treatments in vegetation. Entomophagous populations are very active and efficient on the pest natural limitation. They are particularly abundant and present an important species diversity on the agro-ecosystems in open field area, both in the classic technological system-by plowing, but also in soil no tillage conservative system. The research pointed out the efficiency of biological control, using only the entomophagous natural resources, without insecticides application, in the farming system with protective agro-forestry belts favourable for increasing of useful fauna.",no,,,,,ROMANIAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1222-4227,NA,2015,NA,WOS:000364434200033

Rearing temperature was found to have significant effects on larval-and pupal development and pupal weight in both solitarious and gregarious forms. The effects of host plant condition in both forms were variable; significant effects were consistently observed in pupal development for both gregarious and solitarious forms but not in larval development and pupal weight. Larval and pupal survival of the solitarious form significantly decreased with the decreased in temperature, while only pupal survival decreased with the decreased in temperature in gregarious form. Distinct larval coloration was also observed in different temperatures. Larvae reared at high temperature exhibited lighter coloration, while larvae reared at low temperature exhibited darker coloration regardless of rearing density.

Sticky traps were the most reliable method for detecting thrips flights. Wild plants were inspected four times and revealed that thrips bred all winter. There was no diapause. Seedlings that had sprouted in mid July had second instar larvae by 4 October 1999. The nearest source was self-set plants in an adjacent field. Three published temperature models for onion thrips development were compared. Generation times were similar in summer, but very different in winter. The Texas model with minimum developmental threshold of 11.5 degrees C had the longest winter generation time and required a thrips flight by early August for second instar larvae to develop in the crop by 4 October, whereas the South Auckland model (threshold 8.7 degrees C) required flights by early September.

In an agricultural context, climate change might alter the intensity of competition or facilitation interactions among pests with, potentially, negative consequences on the levels of damage to crop. This could threaten the productivity of agricultural systems and have negative impacts on food security, but has yet been poorly considered in studies. In this contribution, we constructed and evaluated process-based species distribution models for three invasive potato pests in the Tropical Andean Region. These three species have been found to co-occur and interact within the same potato tuber, causing different levels of damage to crop. Our models allowed us to predict the current and future distribution of the species and therefore, to assess how damage to crop might change in the future due to novel interactions. In general, our study revealed the main challenges related to distribution modeling of invasive pests in highly heterogeneous regions. It yielded different results for the three species, both in terms of accuracy and distribution, with one species surviving best at lower altitudes and the other two performing better at higher altitudes. As to future distributions our results suggested that the three species will show different responses to climate change, with one of them expanding to higher altitudes, another contracting its range and the other shifting its distribution to higher altitudes. These changes will result in novel areas of co-occurrence and hence, interactions of the pests, which will cause different levels of damage to crop. Combining population dynamics and species distribution models that incorporate interspecific trade-off relationships in different environments revealed a powerful approach to provide predictions about the response of an assemblage of interacting species to future environmental changes and their impact on process rates.",no,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,1365-2486,2015,10.1111/gcb.12656,WOS:000346698100010

In this study various aspects of the life history of CB were studied, including its distribution, host range, development, reproduction and ability to develop on various cultivated species of plants. CB occurs in almost all areas and habitats in Israel, except in the coldest regions, attacking several caper species (Capparis spp.). When reared on Capparis zoharyi at 25 degrees C, one generation lasted 6 weeks and females laid a single 12-egg cluster every 3 days. Decreases in temperature, but not changes in day length, terminated reproductive activity. CB nymphs survived for up to three months, or even completed their development, on some agricultural plants. However, reproductive activity was initiated only if adults were fed capers. These findings emphasize the importance of capers in the CB life cycle and account for why other plants are rarely attacked. These plants may serve as a temporary refuge for CB when capers are scarce or unsuitable, mainly late in the season.

Recently, it was also reported in several countries in Europe and the Middle East. Because of its invasive potential and the lack of information on the biology of T. absoluta, the present study aimed to estimate its thermal requirements and evaluate the effect of temperature on its development, survival, reproduction and longevity. The experiments were carried out at constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. T. absoluta completed its development at all these temperatures. The thermal requirements were estimated by linear regression; the insects required 416.7 degree-days to complete the cycle from egg to adult, and the lower temperature threshold was estimated to be 8.0 degrees C. The upper temperature threshold estimated for the egg-adult cycle was 37.3 degrees C. The pre-oviposition period was longer at 10 degrees C, but the oviposition period was similar at all the temperatures tested. Fecundity was highest at 20 and 25 degrees C, with averages of 134.8 and 149.1 eggs per female, respectively. The highest percentages of fertile eggs were recorded at 15, 20 and 25 degrees C.

At 16 and 39 degrees C, 100% mortality was recorded during immature development, with the egg, first and second nymphal instars the most susceptible. The lowest mortality was recorded at 28 degrees C (9.8%). As temperature increased, the total developmental period decreased and the shortest duration was recorded at 34 degrees C (12.1-12.2 d). At 37 degrees C, the developmental time was slightly longer (12.5-13.0 d). The thermal requirement for complete development, from egg to adult, was 229.2 DD.

The Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) runs a network of 122-m suction-traps throughout the year to collect migrating aphids. In 2014, the RIS celebrated its 50th anniversary. This paper marks that achievement with an extensive spatiotemporal analysis and the provision of the first British annotated checklist of aphids since 1964. Our main aim was to elucidate mechanisms that advance aphid phenology under climate change and explain these using life-history traits. We then highlight emerging pests using accumulation patterns. Linear and nonlinear mixed-effect models estimated the average rate of change per annum and effects of climate on annual counts, first and last flights and length of flight season since 1965. Two climate drivers were used: the accumulated day degrees above 16 degrees C (ADD16) indicated the potential for migration during the aphid season; the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) signalled the severity of the winter before migration took place. All 55 species studied had earlier first flight trends at rate of =-0611SE 0015daysyear(-1). Of these species, 49% had earlier last flights, but the average species effect appeared relatively stationary (=-0010SE 0022daysyear(-1)). Most species (85%) showed increasing duration of their flight season (=0336 +/- SE 0026daysyear(-1)), even though only 54% increased their log annual count (=0002 +/- SE <0001year(-1)). The ADD16 and NAO were shown to drive patterns in aphid phenology in a spatiotemporal context. Early in the year when the first aphids were migrating, the effect of the winter NAO was highly significant. Further into the year, ADD16 was a strong predictor. Latitude had a near linear effect on first flights, whereas longitude produced a generally less-clear effect on all responses. Aphids that are anholocyclic (permanently parthenogenetic) or are monoecious (non-host-alternating) were advancing their phenology faster than those that were not.

This hot event had no impact on the survival of G. molesta adults, copulation periods or male longevity. However, the event increased female lifespan and the length of the oviposition period, leading to a potential increase in lifetime fecundity and suggesting hormesis. In contrast, exposure of males to this event markedly reduced the net reproductive value. Male heat treatment delayed the onset of oviposition in the females they mated with, as well as causing a decrease in the duration of oviposition period and lifetime fecundity.

In recent years, population densities of this pest in avocado orchards have increased. The objectives of this study were to determine seasonal fluctuations of the populations of eggs, nymphs, and adults of T. aguacate, how these fluctuations are related to the incidence of avocado vegetative shoots, temperature and rainfall at 3 different altitudes in Michoacan, Mexico, i.e., 2,130 m, 1,860 m and 1,293 m. In addition, we attempted to determine the spatial distributions of nymphs and adults found on avocado vegetative shoots. We sampled the populations of adult and immature T. aguacate every 20 days from Jan 2012 to Jul 2013. To estimate population densities, 9 trees were selected in each orchard, and the trees were distributed in the form of a cross. From each replicate of trees, 4 shoots were randomly collected, and the eggs and nymphs were counted on them. Adults counts were obtained from yellow traps established at the 4 cardinal points in each tree. During the same period, young vegetative shoots, temperature and rainfall were recorded. The results showed that this psyllid was not present at all in the orchard located at the low altitude level of 1,293 m. The psyllid was present at the medium altitude site from Jan to Jun, and from Dec to Jun at the high altitude site. All of the development stages were most abundant from Mar to May, when avocado vegetative shoots were most abundant in both years. The abundance of eggs and nymphs showed a positive relationship with young vegetative shoots, a negative relationship with rainfall, and the eggs showed a positive relationship with temperature. The incidence of adults was strongly related with spring budding, but not significantly correlated with temperature.

Threshold values for daily records of maximum air temperature, mean soil temperature, sunshine duration and total precipitation were adjusted to local conditions on the date of first weevil migration in spring. Mean error and the root mean squared error were used to assess model quality, where the error is defined as the number of days between predicted and observed arrival of weevils on the crop (regardless of sign). Best model results predicted first crop invasion by rape stem weevil when the thresholds of daily maximum air temperature 7.8 degrees C, mean soil temperature 6.6 degrees C, daily total precipitation 1.0mm and sunshine duration 1h were matched. This model takes into account meteorological variables likely to influence conditions at the overwintering site of the weevils in the soil, as well as variables that may limit weevil flight. Adjusted air temperature threshold values were consistently lower for Luxembourg sites than for those optimized for Germany. A simple model relating the date of first weevil invasion to accumulated daily maximum air temperature above 0 degrees C (from 1 January) was also evaluated. This proved less suitable for forecasting crop invasion by C.napi. We suggest that phenological models using locally adjusted meteorological-based thresholds have the potential to offer sufficiently accurate forecasts of first immigration flights by C.napi for appropriate timing of insecticide application.

Although much is reported about M. cribraria in its native and invasive range, little information has been documented on the effect of temperatures on its development, longevity, and reproduction. We evaluated the influence of five constant temperatures (17-33 degrees C) on the development, survival, fecundity, and population growth of M. cribraria in the laboratory. The developmental time for egg and nymph stages was shortened significantly with increasing temperature. The developmental time from egg to adult emergence was 114.81, 76.26, 44.54, and 38.54 d at 17, 21, 25, and 29 degrees C, respectively. The nymphs of M. cribraria could not complete full development at a constant 33 degrees C. The developmental threshold temperature estimated for egg to adult was 14.25 degrees C, with a thermal constant of 849.56 degree-days. Females had the longest preoviposition period at 21 degrees C (54.33 d), and the preoviposition period was shortened significantly as the temperature increased. Females had the longest oviposition period (35.33 d) and the highest fecundity (159.67 eggs per female) at 25 degrees C and did not lay any eggs at 17 degrees C. Female longevity was found to be shortest (44.0 d) at 29 degrees C, and similar (75.67-81.50 d) at 17-25 degrees C. The population trend index of M. cribraria was the highest (46.47) at 25 degrees C, followed by 29 degrees C (10.84) and 21 degrees C (6.70).

In this article, we investigated the influence of several factors to devise a sampling strategy to estimate Halotydeus destructor Tucker densities in a canola paddock. Direct visual counts were found to be the most suitable approach for estimating mite numbers, with higher densities detected than the vacuum sampling method. Visual assessments were impacted by the operator, sampling date, and time of day. However, with the exception of operator ( more experienced operator detected higher numbers of mites), no obvious trends were detected. No patterns were found between H. destructor numbers and ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, or soil surface conditions, indicating that these factors may not be of high importance when sampling mites during autumn and winter months. We show further support for an aggregated distribution of H. destructor within paddocks, indicating that a stratified random sampling program is likely to be most appropriate.

This study had two objectives: 1) to examine the effects of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on Hessian fly infestation and 2) to develop a weather-based Hessian fly infestation model for wheat yield loss prediction. At least 20 years of Hessian fly infestation and wheat yield records from two locations in South Georgia were used for this study. The yearly values of infestation were separated by ENSO phase and tested to assess the infestation differences across ENSO phases. Each year, yield losses from infestation were calculated by subtracting the yields of resistant varieties from those of susceptible ones. The yield losses were then separated by ENSO phase and tested. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify the contribution of monthly weather variables and changes in wheat acreage to Hessian fly infestation. Results showed that Hessian fly infestation and yield losses were greatest during the La Nina and least during the El Nino phase. The weather conditions that significantly increased the risk for infestation were those of the August-February period. The risk of infestation was higher during August-September under wetter, cooler conditions and during October-February under drier, warmer conditions.

The eggs of A. obscurus were deposited either individually or in clusters of 2 to 39 individuals mostly in May. At a constant temperature of 20 degrees C, embryogenesis took 22.5 days on average and the percentage of egg hatchability was 95-100%. Head width of the larvae ranged from 0.2 mm (L1) to 1.46 mm (L11). In the laboratory, the larvae passed through 8 to 11 instars during an 18 month period, while in the rearing cage up to 13 instars were recorded over a 30 month period with the life cycle not fully completed at the end of the experiment.

In the rearing cage in contrast, 70% of the larvae reached L5 only at the end of the first year. After the second year, the average larval stage was similar (L10) under both laboratory and field conditions. However, under laboratory conditions at 20 degrees C, approximately 14% of the larvae had transformed into adults after 14 months, hence completing their life cycle with only one overwintering.

This study involved I. the construction of life tables of S. litura at six constant temperatures viz., 20, 25, 27, 30, 33 and 35 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C reared on peanut (Arachis hypogaea L) grown under eCO(2) (550 ppm) concentration in open top chambers ii. Estimation of threshold temperatures and thermal constants and iii. Prediction of the pest scenarios during near and distant future climate change periods. Significantly lower leaf nitrogen, higher carbon and a higher relative proportion of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) were observed in peanut foliage grown under eCO(2) over ambient CO2 (aCO(2)). The mean development time (days) of each stage, egg, larva, pupa, pre-oviposition and total life span decreased from 20 to 35 degrees C temperature on eCO(2) foliage. The thermal requirement of S. litura from egg to egg (within the range of 20 degrees C-35 degrees C) was 538.5 DD on eCO(2) as against 494.5 DD on aCO(2) foliage. Finite (lambda) and intrinsic rates of increase (r(m)), net reproductive rate (R-o), mean generation time (T) and doubling time (DT) of S. litura varied significantly with temperature and CO2 and were found to have quadratic relationships with temperature. The present results on life table parameters estimated by the bootstrap technique showed that the 'r(m)' values of S. litura on eCO(2) foliage were higher than those in the literature indicating a significant influence of eCO(2). The reduction of 'T was noticed from a maximum of 50 days at 20 degrees C to minimum of 22 days at 35 degrees C and 'lambda' which is the indicator of reproductive value of new eggs was highest at 35 degrees C and showed a negative relationship with temperature. The data on these life table parameters were plotted against temperature and two non-linear models developed for both CO2 conditions and used for predicting the pest scenarios. Prediction of pest scenarios based on PRECIS A1B emission scenario data at eleven peanut growing locations of the country during near future (NF) and distant future (DF) climate change periods showed an increase of 'r(m)' and 'lambda' with varied 'R-o' and reduced 'T. The present results indicate that temperature and CO2 are vital in influencing the growth and life table parameters of S. litura and that pest incidence is likely to be higher in the future.

Management in Australia relies on biocontrol using the nematode, Deladenus (= Beddingia) siricidicola (Bedding), which infects and sterilises females who then further disperse the nematode. This pest is spreading into warmer regions in Australia and South America and coupled with the threat of global climate change, there is uncertainty as to how increasing temperatures will affect the biocontrol program. S. noctilio within nematode-inoculated wood were reared at four temperatures (24, 25.3, 26.6 and 28 degrees C) to investigate the effects of elevated temperatures on wasp development (emergence time, sex ratio and size), development of eggs (number, size, and maturation) and infection by the nematode. At 24 degrees C, which reflects current field temperature, S. noctilio were bigger in size and all the eggs were normal and all were infected with nematodes. Modest rises in temperature reflecting climate change scenarios resulted in smaller sized S. noctilio, disrupted egg development and maturation, and lowered the nematode sterilisation rate in females. Reduced S. noctilio female body size and egg infection will likely compromise biocontrol by D. siricidicola in its current distribution, but disrupted egg development may act directly on the pest, limiting dispersal of S. noctilio into subtropical pine plantations and adaptation to climate change.

However, maize production is severely reduced by damage caused by feeding lepidopteran pests. In East and Southern Africa, Chilo partellus is one of the most damaging cereal stem borers mainly found in the warmer lowland areas. In this study, it was hypothesized that the future distribution and abundance of C. partellus may be affected greatly by the current global warming. The temperature-dependent population growth potential of C. partellus was studied on artificial diet under laboratory conditions at six constant temperatures (15, 18, 20, 25, 28, 30, 32 and 35 degrees C), relative humidity of 75 +/- 5% and a photoperiod of L12:L12 h. Several non-linear models were fitted to the data to model development time, mortality and reproduction of the insect species. Cohort updating algorithm and rate summation approach were stochastically used for simulating age and stage structure populations and generate life-table parameters. For spatial analysis of the pest risk, three generic risk indices (index of establishment, generation number and activity index) were visualized in the geographical information system component of the advanced Insect Life Cycle modeling (ILCYM) software. To predict the future distribution of C. partellus we used the climate change scenario A1B obtained from WorldClim and CCAFS databases. The maps were compared with available data on the current distribution of C. partellus in Kenya. The results show that the development times of the different stages decreased with increasing temperatures ranging from 18 to 35 degrees C; at the extreme temperatures, 15 and 38 degrees C, no egg could hatch and no larvae completed development. The study concludes that C. partellus may potentially expands its range into higher altitude areas, highland tropics and moist transitional regions, with the highest maize potential where the species has not been recorded yet.

Our results support the hypothesis that the dispersion and/or feeding behavior of neonate A. argillacea larvae is different between Bt and non-Bt cotton. The presence of the Cry1Ac toxin in Bt cotton plants, and its probable detection by the A. argillacea larvae tasting or eating it, increases the probability of dispersion from the plant where the larvae began. These findings may help to understand how the A. argillacea larvae detect the Cry1Ac toxin in Bt cotton and how the toxin affects the dispersion behavior of the larvae over time. Therefore, our results are extremely important for the management of resistance in populations of A. argillacea on Bt cotton.",no,,,,,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1932-6203,NA,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0111588,WOS:000344402000070

Bactrocera pyrifoliae was found only between elevations of 1000 and 1500 m, heavily infesting peaches and plums from early June to harvest in mid-July. The durations of the egg, larval and pupal stages were determined under controlled environmental conditions in the laboratory, indicating that B. pyrifoliae is a multivoltine species. Larvae were successfully reared on a carrot and corn powder-based diet. Determinations of the appropriate adult density in colony cages, and also optimal temperature conditions for holding adults, were made. Bactrocera pyrifoliae performed better when the temperature was lowered during the night, as would be expected for a species adapted to temperate-like environments. Interestingly, adults originating from field-collected pupae emerged with a 3:1 female-biased sex ratio. Laboratory colonies, by generation seven, appeared to exhibit signs of inbreeding depression and required periodic incorporation of wild insects to restore egg hatch. To develop sound management techniques for populations of B. pyrifoliae infesting peaches, alternate commercial and native hosts infested outside the peach and plum fruiting season must be identified or some form of overwintering mechanism such as reproductive diapause be discovered.

Between 15 degrees C and 30 degrees C, mean larvae development time is divided by four for both species and adult mean longevity is divided by 1.5 and 2.5, for both sexes of S. calamistis and B. fusca, respectively. Fecundity varied according to temperature; the highest was estimated at 22 degrees C and 24 degrees C for B. fusca and S. calamistis, respectively. The lower thermal threshold for B. fusca and S. calamistis was, respectively, 6 degrees C and 9 degrees C, while the upper thermal threshold was 31 degrees C and 32 degrees C, respectively. The highest intrinsic rate of natural increase for B. fusca was obtained at 25 degrees C while for S. calamistis it was obtained at 28 degrees C. The highest net reproduction was obtained at 25 degrees C for both species, but it was higher for S. calamistis than for B. fusca.

In addition, the amount of leaf consumed by larval instars was measured. Females and males successfully developed into adults within 15-35 degrees C. However, no eggs were found at 10 degrees C, and all adults died after exposure to 40 degrees C. The developmental time from egg to adult ranged between 170.5 d at 15 degrees C and 76.6 d at 35 degrees C (F-1,F-97 = 56.2; P < 0.0001). Temperature had a strong effect on the survivorship of A. fusca from the egg to adult emergence, increasing between 15 and 20 degrees C, peaked at 25-30 degrees C, and then declined slightly at 35 degrees C. The different periods of the insect's total reproductive life varied between 15 and 35 degrees C, with the preoviposition periods ranging between 6.82 and 3.24 d, the oviposition period between 17.5 and 4.89 d, and the postoviposition period between 5.29 and 0.82 d. Female longevity was greater than male longevity at all temperatures. The total amount of leaf area consumed by one larva was 402.31 cm(2).

Diamondback moth completed development from second instar to adult within a temperature range of 4.0-37 degrees C, and D. insulare completed its life cycle from egg to adult within a temperature range of 4.0-33 degrees C. The developmental data were fitted into one linear and four nonlinear models. Using goodness-of-fit and the ability to estimate parameters of biological significance as selection criteria, the Wang model was the most acceptable among the nonlinear models to describe the relationship between temperature and development of both species. According to this model, the lower and upper threshold temperatures for diamondback moth were 2.1 and 38.0 degrees C, respectively, and for D. insulare they were 2.1 and 34.0 degrees C, respectively. Based on the Degree Day model, diamondback moth required 143 d above the lower threshold of 4.23 degrees C to complete the life cycle, while D. insulare required 286 d above the lower threshold of 2.57 degrees C.

Flies were exposed to one of four developmental acclimation temperatures (T-acc: 15, 20, 25, 30 degrees C) during their pupal stage and tested at these temperatures (T-test) as adults using a full-factorial study design. Major factors influencing flight performance included sex, body mass, T-test and the interaction between T-test and T-acc. Successful flight performance increased with increasing T-test across all acclimation groups (from 10% at 15 degrees C to 77% at 30 degrees C). Although T-acc did not affect flight performance independently, it did have a significant interaction effect with T-test. Multiple comparisons showed that flies which had been acclimated to 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C performed better than those acclimated to 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C when tested at cold temperatures, but warm-acclimated flies did not outperform cold-acclimated flies at warmer temperatures. This provides partial support for the 'colder is better' hypothesis. To explain these results, several flight-related traits were examined to determine whether T-acc influenced flight performance as a consequence of changes in body or wing morphology, whole-animal metabolic rate or cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity. Although significant effects of T-acc could be detected in several of the traits examined, with an emphasis on sex-related differences, increased flight performance could not be explained solely on the basis of changes in any of these traits.

To enable describing temperature-dependent development through the use of linear and non-linear models, low temperature thresholds and thermal constants for each developmental stage were estimated. Chrysomphalus aonidum was able to perform four generations on green parts (leaves, sprouts) of citrus trees and three on fruits.

Temperature had a significant effect on the developmental rate; female needed 625 degree days (DD) to complete its development, while male needed 833 DD. The low threshold temperatures, together with data from population dynamics, demonstrated that C. aonidum is able to overwinter as second instar and as an adult.

Especially agricultural systems are strongly affected by climate change due to low vegetation cover associated with high temperatures and drought. Nevertheless, the response of soil systems to climate change is little explored. We used microcosms with a simplified soil community to address effects of climate change using independent temperature and dryness gradients and addressed their effects on top-down control and litter decomposition. The community consisted of maize litter as a basal resource, fungi, springtails and as top predators mites and centipedes. As the body-size structure is of high importance for communities, we included differently-sized springtails and predator species. After seven weeks, the experiment was terminated, and the impact of climate change on direct feeding interactions and indirect effects across trophic levels was analysed. With increasing temperature and dryness, consumption rates increased, thereby amplifying the negative influence of consumer populations on their resources. Hence, these climate-change variables increased the top-down control of 1) predators (mainly mites) on springtails and 2) fungi on litter decomposition. In addition, we found that the climate-change variables strengthened trophic cascades from predators on fungi whose density was thus increasingly decoupled from top-down control by their springtail consumers. Their increased decomposition rates are of high importance for carbon cycling and may result in accelerated nutrient turnover. In conclusion, our results suggest that climate change may strongly influence the structure and functioning of soil systems by strengthening consumption rates and trophic cascades, which will have far reaching consequences for the nutrient turnover and productivity of agricultural ecosystems.",yes,experimental,laboratory,consumption,,OIKOS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0030-1299,1600-0706,2014,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00894.x,WOS:000342754100008

The fundamental hypothesis of the present study was that the temperature variations due to global climate change may affect seriously the future distribution and abundance of P. solenopsis, which might further aggravate the crop yield losses. We employed a temperature-based phenology model of P. solenopsis in a geographic information system for mapping population growth potentials of P. solenopsis. The three risk indices viz., establishment risk index, generation index and activity index were computed using interpolated temperature data from worldclim database for current (2000) and future (2050) climatic conditions. The daily minimum and maximum temperature data from four selected weather stations in India were used for analysing within-year variation of pest population. A linear relationship was established between the activity indices and yield losses at various locations reported in literatures for predicting the future trend of yield loss due to climate change. The results revealed that, under current temperature conditions P. solenopsis can complete >4.0 generations per year on similar to 80% of the global cotton production areas. Economic losses are likely to occur in areas where at least 8.0 generations can develop in a year; under current climate similar to 40% areas fall under this category. The increased geographical suitability at higher latitudes in cotton production areas, additional 2.0 generations per year, and 4.0 fold increase of population abundance of P. solenopsis are expected in tropical and sub-tropical cotton areas of Brazil, South Africa, Pakistan and India due to predicted climate change. Analysis of within year population increase at various selected locations in India revealed that, P. solenopsis attained maximum potential population increase during the major cotton growing season (May-June to October-November). On the other hand, the innate ability of P. solenopsis population to increase reduced considerably during off season and cooler winter months. The increased pest activity of P. solenopsis due to climate change may intensify the losses in cotton yield, with forecasted losses in India to increase from existing losses of million US$ 1217.10 to future losses of million US$ 1764.85 by the year 2050.

Here, we examine the role of endogenous density dependence and exogenous factors of climate and human activity in regulating the 37-year population dynamics of an important agricultural insect pest, the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), in North China from 1975 to 2011. Quantitative time-series analysis provided strong evidence explaining long-term population dynamics of the cotton bollworm and its driving factors. Rising temperature and declining rainfall exacerbated the effect of agricultural intensification on continuously weakening the negative density dependence in regulating the population dynamics of cotton bollworms. Consequently, ongoing climate change and agricultural intensification unleashed the tightly regulated pest population and triggered the regional outbreak of H. armigera in 1992. Although the negative density dependence can effectively regulate the population change rate to fluctuate around zero at stable equilibrium levels before and after outbreak in the 1992, the population equilibrium jumped to a higher density level with apparently larger amplitudes after the outbreak. The results highlight the possibility for exogenous factors to induce pest outbreaks and alter the population regulating mechanism of negative density dependence and, thus, the stable equilibrium of the pest population, often to a higher level, posing considerable risks to the provision of agro-ecosystem services and regional food security.

The relationship between weather parameters such as maximum (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min), morning (RH1) and afternoon relative humidity (RH2) and the severity of stem borer damage (SB) were studied. Multiple linear regression analysis was used for formulating pest-weather models at three sites in southern India namely, Warangal, Coimbatore and Pattambi as SB = -66.849 + 2.102 T-max + 0.095 RH1. SB = 156.518 - 3.509 T-min - 0.785 RH1 and SB = 43.483 - 0.418 T-min - 0.283 RH1 respectively. The pest damage predicted using the model at three sites did not significantly differ from the observed damage (t = 0.442; p>0.05). The range of weather parameters favourable for stem borer damage at each site were also predicted using the models. Geospatial interpolation (kriging) of the pest-weather models were carried out to predict the zones of stem borer damage in southern India.

To better understand the population dynamics of this pest in Europe, the phenology, reproductive biology and temperature requirements of Swiss H. halys populations were investigated. Overwintered adults became active in April, but peak oviposition was not observed before early July. Individual females laid on average 79 eggs (maximum of 160). The oviposition period lasted from mid-June to end of September. Eggs laid in August and September did not result in offspring due to the low temperatures in autumn. Under natural fluctuating temperatures, development from egg to adult lasted between 60 and 131 days. The first new generation of adults did not occur before mid-August when the photoperiod was already below 15 h, which likely initiated diapause and suppressed the reproductive activity of new generation adults. Under controlled conditions of 20, 25 and 30 A degrees C, Swiss H. halys populations developed within 75.8, 42.3 and 33.2 days from egg to adult, respectively. No development was possible at or below 15 and at or above 35 A degrees C. The number of degree days required for completion of development from egg to adult was 588.24 DD. Under semi-natural conditions, total mortality of Swiss H. halys populations was 86.7 % with a net reproductive rate of 5.69, indicating growing populations.

J,"Chen, YG; Seybold, SJ",Crepuscular Flight Activity of an Invasive Insect Governed by Interacting Abiotic Factors,"Seasonal and diurnal flight patterns of the invasive walnut twig beetle, Pityophthorus juglandis, were assessed between 2011 and 2014 in northern California, USA in the context of the effects of ambient temperature, light intensity, wind speed, and barometric pressure. Pityophthorus juglandis generally initiated flight in late January and continued until late November. This seasonal flight could be divided approximately into three phases (emergence: January-March; primary flight: May-July; and secondary flight: September-October). The seasonal flight response to the male-produced aggregation pheromone was consistently female-biased (mean of 58.9% females). Diurnal flight followed a bimodal pattern with a minor peak in mid-morning and a major peak at dusk (76.4% caught between 1800 and 2200 h). The primarily crepuscular flight activity had a Gaussian relationship with ambient temperature and barometric pressure but a negative exponential relationship with increasing light intensity and wind speed. A model selection procedure indicated that the four abiotic factors collectively and interactively governed P. juglandis diurnal flight. For both sexes, flight peaked under the following second-order interactions among the factors when: 1) temperature between was 25 and 30 degrees C and light intensity was less than 2000 lux; 2) temperature was between 25 and 35 degrees C and barometric pressure was between 752 and 762 mba (and declined otherwise); 3) barometric pressure was between 755 and 761 mba and light intensity was less than 2000 lux (and declined otherwise); and 4) temperature was ca. 30 degrees C and wind speed was ca. 2 km/h. Thus, crepuscular flight activity of this insect can be best explained by the coincidence of moderately high temperature, low light intensity, moderate wind speed, and low to moderate barometric pressure.

A faster range expansion of insects in a changing climate could lead to mass propagations of pests in forests. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the influence of climatic alterations on leaf palatability. We exposed juvenile Quercus pubescens Willd. individuals of four European provenances (Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, and Italy) to warming and drought. In addition, we conducted a palatability experiment with the pre-exposed Q. pubescens leaves and the caterpillars of the generalist forest pest Lymantria dispar L. (gypsy moth). Consumed leaf dry material, density of trichomes, and specific leaf area were examined. Surprisingly, neither warming nor drought affected the leaf palatability, but palatability was related to the density of trichomes. The Bulgarian provenance of Q. pubescens, which had the lowest density of trichomes, was most palatable.

Summer drought and wildfires are the best-documented drivers causing browning of continental areas, but factors dampening the greening effect of more maritime regions have remained elusive. Here we show how multiple anomalous weather events severely affected the terrestrial productivity during one water year (October 2011-September 2012) in a maritime region north of the Arctic Circle, the Nordic Arctic Region, and contributed to the lowest mean vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index) recorded this century. Procedures for field data sampling were designed during or shortly after the events in order to assess both the variability in effects and the maximum effects of the stressors. Outbreaks of insect and fungal pests also contributed to low greenness. Vegetation greenness in 2012 was 6.8% lower than the 2000-11 average and 58% lower in the worst affected areas that were under multiple stressors.

J,"Esbjerg, P; Sigsgaard, L",Phenology and pest status of Agrotis segetum in a changing climate,"Insects are strongly dependent on climatic factors, especially temperature. For this reason, changes in insect phenology are predicted to be one of the many effects of climate change. We analysed the effect of climate warming on Agrotis segetum (Denis & Schiffermiiller) in Denmark. Agrotis segetum is an agricultural pest that causes root crop damage. Extensive registers of root crop damages by A. segetum in Denmark were kept between 1905 and 1980. These records show a correlation between A. segetum outbreaks and hot, dry summers. The last outbreak in Denmark, in 1976, prompted the implementation of pheromone trap monitoring. Data from these pheromone traps, for the periods between 1981-1991 and 1997-2009, show a decline in the number of A. segetum individuals during 2000-2009. We used this pheromone trapping data to test the hypothesis that temporal changes in phenology and abundance are correlated with temperature and precipitation patterns. As phenological fixed points, we use the time of capture (first, 10%, 50%, 90% and last) of 1st generation A. segetum together with the 10%-90% capture period and the total capture per location for a statistical comparison of the period 1981-1990 versus 2000-2009. We also analysed the effect of temperature on the timing of fixed points and the effect of precipitation on the mean total capture from the summer and the preceding winter. Our analyses showed an earlier occurrence of A. segetum during 2000-2009 than during 1981-1990: all phenological fixed points advanced by 6-9 days. Trap captures of the 1st generation roughly halved from the 1981 1990 decade to the 2000-2009 decade, and a much larger 2nd generation of moths developed in the latest decade. When a second generation occurs, populations in following years decrease because the larval offspring of the 2nd generation cannot successfully overwinter. Our analyses further indicated that increased precipitation during the summers and mild winters contributed to an overall decline in the populations of this pest. The presence of A. segetum remains sufficient to be a potential threat to yields. Forecasting an economically important attack of A. segetum is challenging because of the early emergence of A. segetum and more variable local weather conditions than 20 years ago; forecasting relies on the timely and correct delivery of monitoring results. Farmers are a vital source of information for monitoring, for estimating control requests and for timing the emergence of A. segtum. However, the growing frequency of no-risk forecasts has reduced the interest and lowered the motivation of farmers to participate in monitoring programs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Dale, AG; Frank, SD",The Effects of Urban Warming on Herbivore Abundance and Street Tree Condition,"Trees are essential to urban habitats because they provide services that benefit the environment and improve human health. Unfortunately, urban trees often have more herbivorous insect pests than rural trees but the mechanisms and consequences of these infestations are not well documented. Here, we examine how temperature affects the abundance of a scale insect, Melanaspis tenebricosa (Comstock) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), on one of the most commonly planted street trees in the eastern U. S. Next, we examine how both pest abundance and temperature are associated with water stress, growth, and condition of 26 urban street trees. Although trees in the warmest urban sites grew the most, they were more water stressed and in worse condition than trees in cooler sites. Our analyses indicate that visible declines in tree condition were best explained by scale-insect infestation rather than temperature. To test the broader relevance of these results, we extend our analysis to a database of more than 2700 Raleigh, US street trees. Plotting these trees on a Landsat thermal image of Raleigh, we found that warmer sites had over 70% more trees in poor condition than those in cooler sites. Our results support previous studies linking warmer urban habitats to greater pest abundance and extend this association to show its effect on street tree condition. Our results suggest that street tree condition and ecosystem services may decline as urban expansion and global warming exacerbate the urban heat island effect. Although our non-probability sampling method limits our scope of inference, our results present a gloomy outlook for urban forests and emphasize the need for management tools.

The accurate determination of thermal constant values and the lower and upper developmental thresholds of Hyadaphis foeniculi (Passerini) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Miller (Apiales: Apiaceae)) crops would obviously benefit the effective application of control measures. This paper is a study of the biology and thermal requirements of H. foeniculi. Winged insects were collected from fennel crops at the Embrapa Algodao in Campina Grande, Paraiba. Nymphs (age <= 24 h) produced by winged insects were subjected to constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 28, 30 or 33 degrees C, a photophase of 12 h and a relative humidity of 70 +/- 10%. The results of the study showed that at temperatures between 15 and 30 degrees C, H. foeniculi nymphs were able to develop normally. The four instars were found at all temperatures tested. However, temperatures of 3 and 33 degrees C were lethal to the nymphs. The nymph stage development time varied from 5 (30 degrees C) to 19 (15 degrees C) days. The influence of temperature on the development time is dependent on the instar. The base temperature (Tb) and the thermal constant (K) for the nymph stage were estimated at 11.2 degrees C and 107.5 degree-days, respectively. The shortest nymph development stage was observed at 30 degrees C, and the highest nymph viability (85.0%) was observed at 28 degrees C.

J,"Elderd, BD; Reilly, JR",Warmer temperatures increase disease transmission and outbreak intensity in a host-pathogen system,"While rising global temperatures are increasingly affecting both species and their biotic interactions, the debate about whether global warming will increase or decrease disease transmission between individuals remains far from resolved. This may stem from the lack of empirical data. Using a tractable and easily manipulated insect host-pathogen system, we conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to examine how increased temperatures affect disease transmission using the crop-defoliating pest, the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and its species-specific baculovirus, which causes a fatal infection. To examine the effects of temperature on disease transmission in the field, we manipulated baculovirus density and temperature. As infection occurs when a host consumes leaf tissue on which the pathogen resides, baculovirus density was controlled by placing varying numbers of infected neonate larvae on experimental plants. Temperature was manipulated by using open-top chambers (OTCs). The laboratory experiments examined how increased temperatures affect fall armyworm feeding and development rates, which provide insight into how host feeding behaviour and physiology may affect transmission. Disease transmission and outbreak intensity, measured as the cumulative fraction infected during an epizootic, increased at higher temperatures. However, there was no appreciable change in the mean transmission rate of the disease, which is often the focus of empirical and theoretical research. Instead, the coefficient of variation (CV) associated with the transmission rate shrunk. As the CV decreased, heterogeneity in disease risk across individuals declined, which resulted in an increase in outbreak intensity. In the laboratory, increased temperatures increased feeding rates and decreased developmental times. As the host consumes the virus along with the leaf tissue on which it resides, increased feeding rate is likely to increase the probability of an individual consuming virus-infected leaf tissue. On the other hand, decreased developmental time increases the sloughing of midgut cells, which is predicted to hinder viral infection. Increases in outbreak intensity or epizootic severity, as the climate warms, may lead to changes in the long-term dynamics of pests whose populations are strongly affected by host-pathogen interactions. Overall, this work demonstrates that the usual assumptions governing these effects, via changes in the mean transmission rate alone, may not be correct.",yes,experimental,laboratory,consumption,,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0021-8790,1365-2656,2014,10.1111/1365-2656.12180,WOS:000337618100010

The study of future impacts on maize remains relatively unexplored. Here we modeled the distribution and development of the maize borer Sesamia nonagrioides Lef. in Europe using a 25 x 25 km grid. We studied the pest potential winter survival, distribution, and phenological development at three time horizons, 2000, 2030, and 2050, using the A1B scenario of the international panel on climate change (IPCC). A new model based on the lethal dose exposure concept was developed to simulate winter survival. Two approaches for the simulation of winter survival were compared: the first using air temperature only as weather input, named AirMS; the second taking into account the fraction of larvae overwintering in the soil, therefore considering also soil temperature, named SoilAirMS. The survival model was linked to a phenological model to simulate the potential development. Results show that soil temperature is an essential input for correctly simulating S. nonagrioides distribution. The SoilAirMS approach showed the best agreement (+537 grid cells), compared to the AirMS approach (-2,039 grid cells). Nevertheless, the AirMS approach allowed identifying areas where the agronomic practice suggested for controlling S. nonagrioides should be considered ineffective. This practice consists in uprooting and exposing the stubble on the soils surface for exposing larvae to winter cold. The projections to 2030 and 2050 suggested an overall slight increase of more suitable conditions for the S. nonagrioides in almost all the areas where it develops under the baseline. In these areas, S. nonagrioides could become a new insect pest with a potential strong impact on maize.

But the biological effects of an increased night-time temperature combined with high daytime temperature are unclear. We used six thermal regimens to simulate NTs on hot days and investigated the effects of night warming on life-history traits of the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. Experimental temperatures fluctuated in continuous diurnal cycles, increasing from 27 degrees C to a maximum 35 degrees C and then declining to 27 degrees C gradually before further dropping to different minima (13, 16, 19, 21, 23 or 25 degrees C) representing NTs. When compared to expectations based on constant temperatures, night warming raised the optimum temperature for development by 3 degrees C, in contrast to results from experiments where temperature variability was altered symmetrically or in a parallel manner. Night warming also reduced aphid survival under heat from 75% to 37% and depressed adult performance by up to 50%. Overall, night warming exacerbated the detrimental effects of hot days on the intrinsic rate of population increase, which was predicted to drop by 30% when night-time minimum temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C.

J,"Wang, HH; Reitz, SR; Xiang, JC; Smagghe, G; Lei, ZR",Does Temperature-Mediated Reproductive Success Drive the Direction of Species Displacement in Two Invasive Species of Leafminer Fly?,"Liriomyza sativae and L. trifolii (Diptera: Agromyzidae) are two highly invasive species of leafmining flies, which have become established as pests of horticultural crops throughout the world. In certain regions where both species have been introduced, L. sativae has displaced L. trifolii, whereas the opposite has occurred in other regions. These opposing outcomes suggest that neither species is an inherently superior competitor. The regions where these displacements have been observed (southern China, Japan and western USA) are climatically different. We determined whether temperature differentially affects the reproductive success of these species and therefore if climatic differences could affect the outcome of interspecific interactions where these species are sympatric. The results of life table parameters indicate that both species can develop successfully at all tested temperatures (20, 25, 31, 33 degrees C). L. sativae had consistently higher fecundities at all temperatures, but L. trifolii developed to reproductive age faster. Age-stage specific survival rates were higher for L. sativae at low temperatures, but these were higher for L. trifolii at higher temperatures. We then compared the net reproductive rates (R-0) for both species in pure and mixed cultures maintained at the same four constant temperatures. Both species had significantly lower net reproductive rates in mixed species cultures compared with their respective pure species cultures, indicating that both species are subject to intense interspecific competition.

The thrips complex consists predominantly of tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca (Hinds), with smaller percentages of western flower thrips, F. occidentalis Pergande, eastern flower thrips, F. tritici (Fitch) and onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman. Onion thrips has become a greater concern in the last 10 years likely due to the introduction of a more aggressive biotype of T. tabaci on onions coming from Peru into the Vidalia region. A preliminary laboratory bioassay at 25 degrees C suggested that this onion thrips biotype could out-compete tobacco thrips on onions. Surveys were conducted from 2004 through 2013 in commercial Vidalia onion fields to determine if this increase in the percentage of onion thrips would occur. Average seasonal temperatures were highly correlated (r = 0.811) with percent T. tabaci and negatively correlated (r = -0.807) with F. fusca. The results suggest that temperature might regulate the proportion of onion thrips to tobacco thrips in the field, with a higher percentage of tobacco thrips occurring during cool winters and more onion thrips occurring in warm winters. Nevertheless, F. fusca continues to be the dominant thrips species in the Vidalia onion winter growing region of Georgia averaging 78% of the adult thrips population from 2004 to 2013.",no,,,,,FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0015-4040,1938-5102,2014,10.1653/024.097.0203,WOS:000339657600003

To monitor and manage this pest effectively it is necessary to understand its population dynamics and demographics, as well as the physiological responses of soybean plants to its feeding. In this study, using field surveying and suction-trap monitoring, we investigated the population dynamics of the soybean aphid in Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province in northeastern China during 2009-2012. The results indicated that the population dynamics of the soybean aphid followed a unimodal curve distribution, with the insect generally colonizing soybean fields from the middle of June to early July and the population reaching a peak between early July and early August. On the whole, soybean aphids occurred in suction-traps at least 2 weeks earlier than they were found in field surveys.

The life table parameters clearly showed that this aphid had a short doubling time (4.73 +/- 0.21 days), and 7.36 +/- 0.98 nymphs were produced by a soybean aphid adult during its lifetime (13.57 +/- 0.30 days). Finally, biochemical assays indicated that the amount of malondialdehyde and the activities of four defense-related enzymes in soybean leaves significantly changed between 0 day and 7 days of aphid infestation. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and catalase (CAT) activities increased more dramatically after 1 day of aphid feeding. In addition, significantly higher levels of superoxide dismutase and CAT were found after aphid feeding for 7 days, whereas there was no significant change in the activities of peroxidase and PPO.

This study was conducted to investigate the stage-specific development and survival of P. maculiventris at eight constant temperatures (13.2, 18.4, 21.7, 23.7, 27.2, 32.7, 35.2, and 40.6 A degrees C) covering the entire thermal range for P. maculiventris development.

In the case of climate change, many species may be affected directly and subsequently initiate numerous indirect effects that propagate throughout the community. Therefore, the net effect of climate change on any one species is a function of the direct and indirect effects. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of climate warming on corn leaf aphids, a pest of corn and other grasses, by performing an experimental manipulation of temperature, predators, and two common aphid-tending ants. Although warming had a positive direct effect on aphid population growth rate, warming reduced aphid abundance when ants and predators were present. This occurred because winter ants, which aggressively defend aphids from predators under control temperatures, were less aggressive toward predators and less abundant when temperatures were increased. In contrast, warming increased the abundance of cornfield ants, but they did not protect aphids from predators with the same vigor as winter ants. Thus, warming broke down the ant-aphid mutualism and counterintuitively reduced the abundance of this agricultural pest.",yes,field,abundance,,,ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0012-9658,1939-9170,2014,10.1890/13-1977.1,WOS:000337218500007

We examined the impacts of defoliation on Eucalyptus globulus plantation C stocks under current and future climates using Mycospharella Leaf Disease (MLD) as a case study, hypothesising that biomass C sequestered in plantations would decrease with a warming and drying climate, and that impacts of defoliation would be strongly site dependent. Six E. globulus plantation sites with varying productivity were selected for the study. Current (1961-2005) and future (2030 and 2070) severity and frequency of MLD were estimated for each site using the bioclimatic niche model CLIMEX, and used as inputs to the process-based forest productivity model CABALA. CABALA was used to develop annual estimates of total living and dead biomass for current, 2030 and 2070 climate scenarios. Averaged annual biomass outputs were used to initialise the carbon accounting model FullCAM for calculation of C sequestered in living and dead biomass over a growing cycle. E. globulus plantations were predicted to sequester between 4.8 and 13.4 Mg C ha(-1).year(-1) over 10 years under current climatic conditions. While our estimates suggest that overall this is likely to increase slightly under future climates (up to a maximum of 17.2 Mg C ha(-1).year(-1) in 2030, and a shift in minimum and maximum values to 7.6 and 17.6 respectively in 2070), we predict considerable between-site variation. Our results suggest that biomass C sequestration will not necessarily be enhanced by future climatic conditions in all locations. We predict that biomass C sequestration may be reduced considerably by defoliation meaning that any gains in C sequestration associated with changing climate may be substantially offset by defoliation. While defoliation has a generally small impact under current climatic conditions in these plantations, the impact is likely to increase in the future, with reductions of up to 40% predicted for some sites under future climates.

We also accounted for historical changes in forestry practices and examined effects of past insecticide use to suppress outbreaks. Analysis of relationships between severity or occurrence of outbreaks and detrended measures of temperature and precipitation revealed a mixture of positive and negative relationships between temperature and outbreak activity. Two moth species (P.flammea and Dendrolimus pini) exhibited lower outbreak activity following years or decades of unusually warm temperatures, whereas a sawfly (Diprion pini), for which voltinism is influenced by temperature, displayed increased outbreak occurrence in years of high summer temperatures. We detected only one apparent effect of precipitation, which showed Dendrolimus pini outbreaks tending to follow drought. Wavelet analysis of outbreak time series suggested climate change may be associated with collapse of L.monacha and Dendrolimus pini outbreak cycles (loss of cyclicity and discontinuation of outbreaks, respectively), but high-frequency cycles for B.piniarius and P.flammea in the late 1900s. Regional outbreak severity was generally not related to past suppression efforts (area treated with insecticides). Recent shifts in forestry practices affecting tree species composition roughly coincided with high-frequency outbreak cycles in B.piniarius and P.flammea but are unlikely to explain the detected relationships between climate and outbreak severity or collapses of outbreak cycles.

Previous research indicates that heat treatments in Combination with high Concentrations of Carbon dioxide and low Concentrations of oxygen may be effective for Controlling diapausing Codling moth, a quarantine pest in walnuts, but treatment requires long times and the killing mechanism is unknown. In this study, the effects of temperature and modified atmospheres on metabolism in diapausing 5th instar Codling moth (Cydia pomonella) was investigated with multi-channel differential scanning Calorimeters, one equipped with an oxygen sensor. O-2 Consumption and metabolic heat rates in air were measured simultaneously at isothermal temperatures from 5 to 50 degrees C at 5 degrees C intervals. Both rates increased with increasing temperatures from 5 to 40 degrees C. The ratio of metabolic heat rate to O-2 Consumption rate at temperatures <= 40 degrees C shows that a portion of the metabolic heat is from normal anabolic reactions of metabolism. At 45 and 50 degrees C in air, O-2 Consumption and metabolic heat rates dropped to near zero.

In order to devise an ecology-based and cost-effective control program, we collected life table data and consumption rates from larvae reared indoors at a constant temperature of 25 degrees C, or outdoors at ambient temperatures during the spring and fall of 2010. A computer simulation was then used to project the population growth and damage potential of S. litura on peanuts. RESULTS Laboratory-reared S. litura individuals produced 3548 eggs/female, whereas those reared outdoors produced 3452 and 3072 eggs/female in the spring and fall, respectively. The intrinsic rate of increase was 0.1828, 0.1308 and 0.1545 day(-1) , and the net consumption rate was 194.0, 132.2 and 166.6 cm(2) larva(-1) at 25 degrees C, in spring and fall, respectively. Population projection showed a faster growth and higher damage potential of S. litura in the fall. CONCLUSION Population projections based on life tables and stage-specific consumption rates can reveal the stage structure and damage potential of the pest population.

According to field observations, adult D. suzukii ceased to appear from the end of July 2010, when the average temperature exceeded 28 A degrees C or when the temperature within a day exceeded 33 A degrees C for 8 h or more. Experiments in which the mating temperature fluctuated within a day revealed that both the number of eggs oviposited and their hatch rate were significantly suppressed when the daily temperature regime during mating was either 31 A degrees C for 12 h/25 A degrees C for 12 h or 33 A degrees C for 8 h/25 A degrees C for 16 h, relative to the values at 25 A degrees C for 24 h.",yes,both,,fecundity,,APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0003-6862,1347-605X,2014,10.1007/s13355-014-0249-z,WOS:000335506700011
J,"Pan, HS; Liu, B; Lu, YH; Desneux, N",Identification of the Key Weather Factors Affecting Overwintering Success of Apolygus lucorum Eggs in Dead Host Tree Branches,"Understanding the effects of weather on insect population dynamics is crucial to simulate and forecast pest outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important with the effects of climate change. The mirid bug Apolygus lucorum is an important pest on cotton, fruit trees and other crops in China, and primarily lays its eggs on dead parts of tree branches in the fall for subsequent overwintering. As such, the eggs that hatch the following spring are most strongly affected by ambient weather factors, rather than by host plant biology. In this study, we investigated the effects of three major weather factors: temperature, relative humidity and rainfall, on the hatching rate of A. lucorum eggs overwintering on dead branches of Chinese date tree (Ziziphus jujuba). Under laboratory conditions, rainfall (simulated via soaking) was necessary for the hatching of overwintering A. lucorum eggs. In the absence of rainfall (unsoaked branches), very few nymphs successfully emerged under any of the tested combinations of temperature and relative humidity. In contrast, following simulated rainfall, the hatching rate of the overwintering eggs increased dramatically. Hatching rate and developmental rate were positively correlated with relative humidity and temperature, respectively. Under field conditions, the abundance of nymphs derived from overwintering eggs was positively correlated with rainfall amount during the spring seasons of 2009-2013, while the same was not true for temperature and relative humidity. Overall, our findings indicate that rainfall is the most important factor affecting the hatching rate of overwintering A. lucorum eggs on dead plant parts and nymph population levels during the spring season. It provides the basic information for precisely forecasting the emergence of A. lucorum and subsequently timely managing its population in spring, which will make it possible to regional control of this insect pest widely occurring in multiple crops in summer.",yes,both,abundance,,,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1932-6203,NA,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0094190,WOS:000334107500131

It first invaded China from Kazakhstan in 1990s and now is a major pest of potato in many areas of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature on the spread of Colorado potato beetle in China after its invasion. Cold temperature in winter (December) and high temperature in summer (July) were analyzed in accordance with the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang. The boundary between the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang nearly coincided with the -8 degrees C isotherm of monthly mean minimum temperature in winter. The stress of the low temperature in winter for Colorado potato beetle basically disappeared in the southeastern Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province of China, suggesting that the Hexi Corridor is the best channel to prevent any long-distance invasions of Colorado potato beetle into the Central Plains region. However, in Turpan City in northeastern Xinjiang, the extremely hot weather in the summer prevents the local colonization of Colorado potato beetle. Furthermore, according to our monitoring, high temperature in summer also limited Colorado potato beetle to diffuse eastward through Turpan.

Although these beetles do not attack and kill healthy trees, their gallery holes and accompanying black and gray stain associated with symbiotic ambrosial fungi can cause significant economic losses to commercial logs and wood products. Beetles were collected along a 1,100-km latitudinal transect 4 times at 2-week intervals at 43 sites beginning early July using Lindgren-funnel traps baited with ethanol, alpha-pinene, and lineatin. Average annual temperature and precipitation were used to partition the state into 25 climatic zones. Large-scale patterns of beetle distribution were correlated with elevation and the temperature and precipitation zones. Results indicate that reasonably accurate predictions of beetle abundance can be generated using models based on trap data collected across several climate zones. Predictions derived from this latitudinal transect can be extrapolated to more remote areas using species environment relationships based on temperature and precipitation combinations. Partitioning large geographic areas using climatic zones offers a logical approach for predicting insect activity in remote areas, and if implemented on a long-term basis would be able to provide estimates of yearly and seasonal trends in the infestation.

The main risk arises when the emergence of the adult midges coincides with wheat ear emergence. The emergence of adult midges was monitored in Belgium over four years and analysed against climate data, establishing the significance of specific rainfall events as triggers for the final phase of development prior to emergence. This discovery, combined with experience from previous models, was incorporated into a new forecasting model, described in this paper. The new model consists of three separate phases. The first phase comprised a temperature accumulation of 250 degree-days (DD) above 3 degrees C, starting from 1 January. Once this initial condition is satisfied, the second phase starts, and it lasts until the occurrence of a double signal consisting of a rise in the mean daily temperature up to 13 degrees C, followed by rainfall. This rainfall event triggers an accumulation phase of 160 DD above 7 degrees C. Once this last condition is met, the adults emerge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, the DD model is inaccurate, as is the case for the Oriental migratory locust. To improve the existing DD model for this pest, we first studied locust development in seven growth chambers, each of which simulated the complete growing-season climate of a specific region in China (Baiquan, Chengde, Tumotezuoqi, Wenan, Rongan, Qiongzhong, or Qiongshan). In these seven treatments, locusts completed 0.95, 1, 1.1, 2.2, 2.95, 3.95, and 4.95 generations, respectively. Hence, in the Baiquan (700), Rongan (2400), Qiongzhong (3200), and Qiongshan (2400) treatments, the final generation were unable to lay eggs. In a second experiment, we reared locusts for a full generation in growth chambers, at different constant temperatures. This experiment provided two important findings. First, temperatures between 32 and 42 degrees C did not influence locust development rate. Hence, the additional heat provided by temperatures above 32 degrees C did not add to the total heat units acquired by the insects, according to the traditional DD model. Instead, temperatures above 32 degrees C represent overflow heat, and can not be included when calculating total heat acquired during development. We also noted that females raised at constant 21 degrees C failed to oviposit. Hence, temperatures lower than 21 degrees C should be deducted when calculating total heat acquired during adult development. Using our experimental findings, we next micmiked 24-h temperature curve and constructed a new DD model based on a 24-h temperature integral calculation. We then compared our new model with the traditional DD model, results showed the DD deviation was 166 heat units in Langfang during 2011.

Up to 1993, the industry recommendation for commencement of the codling moth spray programme was at 75 % petal fall in order to avoid the negative impact of organophosphate sprays on bees during bloom. However, codling moth can emerge, mate and oviposit before and during full bloom in pome fruit orchards. Consequently, petal-fall does not necessarily correspond with the commencement of egg-laying or first egg hatch. The availability of insecticides with a softer environmental profile made it possible to apply sprays earlier than 75 % petal-fall. The development of phenology models provided a means of accurately predicting biological events such as the initiation of egg-laying and first egg hatch. Using lower and upper development thresholds of 10 degrees C and 32 degrees C, respectively, and hourly temperature recordings, phenology models were evaluated by comparing the number of degree-days (degrees D) accumulated using a selection of three biofixes, and date of first egg hatch. The number of degrees D accumulated from the selection of biofixes to first observed egg hatch varied from 130.7 to 179. The least variation in the number of degrees D between biofix and first egg hatch occurred when the second trap catch was used as the biofix. A biofix based on the first evening when the temperature reached or exceeded 17 degrees C at 18:00 after first trap catch also showed less variation than when the biofix was based on first trap catch. The mean number of degrees D at which 50 % of the moths of the first flight emerged was 166.6 degrees D, while the mean number of degrees D at which 50 % oviposition occurred was 290 degrees D following biofix. The number of degrees D between the second and third flight biofixes varied between 488.7 and 531.2 degrees D, with a mean of 508.1 degrees D.

J,"Jeffs, CT; Leather, SR","Effects of extreme, fluctuating temperature events on life history traits of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae","Altered temperatures affect insects' life history traits, such as development period and fecundity, which ultimately determine population growth rates. Understanding insects' thermal biology is therefore integral to population forecasting and pest management decision-making such as when to utilise crop spraying or biological control. Aphids are important crop pests in temperate regions, causing considerable yield losses. The aphid thermal-biology literature is, however, heavily biased towards the effects of rising mean temperatures, whereas the effects of fluctuating, extreme climatic events (e.g., heat waves and sub-zero cold periods) are largely overlooked. This study assessed the effects of laboratory-simulated heat waves and sub-zero cold periods on the survival, development period, and fecundity of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae: Microsiphini), in addition to assessing maternal effects on the birth weight and development period of the offspring of exposed individuals. Exposure to heat stress periods (total of 16h at 30 degrees C) significantly reduced aphid fecundity and increased physiological development period (in day-degrees) resulting in a reduced population growth rate. Cold exposure (total of 1.33h at -15 degrees C) reduced population growth rate due to an elongated development period (in days), but did not affect fecundity or physiological development period (in day-degrees). Both cold and heat stress significantly reduced aphid survival. Maternal experience of heat stress reduced nymphal birth weight although nymphal development period was not affected by either cold or heat stress. The results suggest that including the effects of fluctuating, extreme temperature events on aphid life history in population forecast models is likely to be of great importance to pest management decision-making.

Mowing height is an easily manipulated aspect of lawn management. We tested the hypothesis that elevated mowing of tall fescue lawn grass promotes a larger, more diverse community of arthropod natural enemies which in turn provides stronger biological control services, and the corollary hypothesis that doing so also renders the turf itself less suitable for growth of insect pests. Turf-type tall fescue was mowed low (6.4 cm) or high (10.2 cm) for two growing seasons, natural enemy populations were assessed by vacuum sampling, pitfall traps, and ant baits, and predation and parasitism were evaluated with sentinel prey caterpillars, grubs, and eggs. In addition, foliage-feeding caterpillars and root-feeding scarab grubs were confined in the turf to evaluate their performance. Although some predatory groups (e.g., rove beetles and spiders) were more abundant in high-mowed grass, predation rates were uniformly high because ants, the dominant predators, were similarly abundant regardless of mowing height. Lower canopy temperatures in high-mowed grass were associated with slower growth of grass-feeding caterpillars. Higher lawn mowing reduces fuel consumption and yard waste, and promotes a deep, robust root system that reduces need for water and chemical inputs. Although in this study elevated mowing height did not measurably increase the already-high levels of predation, it did suggest additional ways through which bottom-up effects on insect pest growth might interact with natural enemies to facilitate conservation biological control.",no,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0364-152X,1432-1009,2014,10.1007/s00267-013-0226-2,WOS:000331956000013

Even in years of high overall numbers of cereal leaf beetle, relatively few fields were heavily infested (with 20 or more cereal leaf beetle eggs + larvae per 0.09 m(2)) at either egg or larval peak density during the growing season. In individual fields, the number of immature cereal leaf beetle (eggs + larvae) at peak larval density was positively related to the number of immature cereal leaf beetles present earlier at peak egg density. Although there was large variation among years in when cereal leaf beetle egg and larval numbers peaked during the season as measured by degree-day accumulation from 1 January, much of this variation was accounted for by the warmth of the early spring before significant egg laying occurred. Hence, degree-day estimates that account for early spring warmth can guide growers in scouting grain fields at peak egg densities to identify fields at high risk of subsequent economic damage from cereal leaf beetle larval feeding.

In the second year, the effects of the same treatments on laboratory-raised eggs in diapause were investigated. The effects of temperature on percent egg hatching, time to hatching, and hatching duration were determined. When field-collected eggs were held at 0 and 5 degrees C, they terminated postdiapause within 11 days. The percent hatching tended to decline with an increased duration of exposure at temperatures greater than 5 degrees C. Diapause terminated slowly (> 37 days) and with a high percentage of hatching for postdiapause eggs held at 10 degrees C. There was a positive correlation between temperature and the speed of postdiapause development for field-collected eggs held at constant temperatures between 10 and 25 degrees C. However, the number of days to the first hatch was significantly longer than for eggs treated with lower temperatures before being transferred to 25 degrees C.

However, eggs treated at a constant 20 or 25 degrees C for 200 days developed into pharate larva but did not hatch even after a subsequent chill.

The present study, conducted at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad, India, aimed at 1) construction of life tables at six constant temperatures viz., 20, 25, 27, 30, 33, and 35 +/- 0.5(degrees)C for Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera) reared on sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) grown under ambient and elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) (550 ppm) concentration in open top chambers and 2) prediction of the pest status in near future (NF) and distant future (DF) climate change scenarios at major sunflower growing locations of India. Significantly lower leaf nitrogen, higher carbon and higher relative proportion of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) were observed in sunflower foliage grown under eCO(2) over ambient. Feeding trials conducted on sunflower foliage obtained from two CO2 conditions showed that the developmental time of S. litura (Egg to adult) declined with increase in temperature and was more evident at eCO(2). Finite (lambda) and intrinsic rates of increase (r(m)), net reproductive rate (R-o), mean generation time, (T) and doubling time (DT) of S. litura increased significantly with temperature up to 27-30(degrees)C and declined with further increase in temperature. Reduction of `T' was observed from maximum value of 58 d at 20(degrees)C to minimum of 24.9 d at 35(degrees)C. The DT of population was higher (5.88 d) at 20(degrees)C and lower (3.05 d) at 30(degrees)C temperature of eCO(2). The data on these life table parameters were plotted against temperature and two nonlinear models were developed separately for each of the CO2 conditions for predicting the pest scenarios. The NF and DF scenarios temperature data of four sunflower growing locations in India is based on PRECIS A1B emission scenario. It was predicted that increased 'r(m)', 'lambda', and `R-o' and reduced `T' would occur during NF and DF scenario over present period at all locations.

A field study of the insect fauna and the phenology of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L. in canola was conducted during the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 growing seasons. The study was carried out at the Experimental farm, Faculty of Agriculture, Suez Canal University, Ismailia. A total of 31 insect species were recorded from the crop (13 pest species, 9 natural enemy species and 9 insect pollinators). Diamondback moth and cabbage aphid were the dominant pests, lady beetles and hoverflies were the most abundant natural enemies and honeybees were the dominant pollinators. The phenology, infestation rate and parasitism of P xylostella were determined for the two growing seasons.

These analyses should help derive an appropriate model describing the effects of weather parameters on pest occurrence as a basis for calculating regionalized climate change scenarios for pollen beetle infestation. The investigation was based on 30-year long-term data collected during annual pest monitoring by the plant protection service of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern from 1981 to 2011. Pollen beetle infestation data were collected at 14 to 32 different sites per year during different developmental stages. Data collected before anthesis, at stages 7-8 (Feekes) and 51-61 (BBCH), were used for further analysis. Daily weather data (mean temperature, precipitation sum, solar radiation and wind speed) were collected at 25 measurement stations of the German Meteorological Service (DWD). Missing data from smaller stations that measured fewer variables were interpolated from data from the main weather stations by the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research. Data between weather stations were interpolated by inverse distance weighting to connect weather and pest data. This method can be easily applied by calculating Thiessen polygons using the ArcGIS software package by ESRI. Subsequently, relationships between weather and pest data were identified by Window Pane analysis (COAKLEY & al., 1988; COAKLEY, 1989; CALVERO JR. & al., 1996, PIETRAVALLE & al., 2003; TEBEEST & al., 2008; TEBEEST & al., 2009). Briefly, weather variables were averaged over periods of 5 to 300 days, starting on days between 1 and 296 and ending on days between 5 and 300, before monitoring date and correlation coefficients were calculated between mean weather variables averaged over different numbers of days and pest data at maximum infestation. The results were displayed as Correlograms (GOLDWIN, 1982), which show the significant correlation coefficients for each investigated weather parameter and test period. Functional relationships were derived by regression analysis, and scenarios shall be calculated to forecast the potential spatial and temporal changes in the risk of pollen beetle infestation in Mecldenburg-Vorpommern with the projected climatic changes using different climate model scenarios, such as REMO and STARS. This methodological approach is suitable for the calculation and mapping of relationships between scaled weather data and infestation values.

Between July 2011 to June 2012, some new threats of pests and diseases were observed during scouting and fixed plot surveys of litchi orchards in Bihar that were hitherto either unnoticed or of minor importance. Studies were conducted to assess the occurrence and level of damage by these pests and diseases. Ten trees in an orchard were randomly selected and observations recorded in three branches having approximately 200 leaflets. Pests were reared in the laboratory for identification and study of their biology. The symptoms of damage were described. Three insect pests viz., red weevil (Apoderus blandus), semilooper (Anisodes illepidaria) and bagworm (Eumeta crameri) and one disease viz., leaf and twig blight (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Gloeosporium sp.) were identified. While red weevil and semilooper damaged young leaves, bagworm preferred older leaves. Temperature fluctuations, particularly during peak summer and winter, negatively affected the activity of red weevil and semilooper while bagworm was affected by high temperature during summer. The results indicated that trees having highly damaged canopies (>50% foliage) by these pests represented as much as 40.0% while partially damaged (10-30% foliage) plants represented were up to 20.8%. The incidence of leaf and twig blight disease was from 28.1 to 66.3%. The percentage infected leaflets in a tree varied from 21.0 to 37.0, whereas disease severity index was 3.7 to 47.8%. The disease manifested itself from the beginning of August to the end of February. The occurrence of A. illepidaria and E. crameri is being reported on litchi for the first time from India.

In this paper we explore how warmer temperature may affect the performance of southern European populations of the pine bark beetle Ips acuminatus. During a seven-year-long study (2007-2013) we analysed: (a) insect voltinism and phenology, (b) annual trend of the mean population density, and (c) their correlations with temperature. The mean number of adults per trap captured during the flying season (May-August) showed a bivoltine phenological pattern with two flight periods, in May after hibernation and in July, when a second generation begin. The breeding performance of the first generation was positively correlated with temperature In the warmer years, the amount of summer captures resulted higher than the spring ones, suggesting a positive breeding performance of the first generation and the beginning of a large second generation. The population density was instead negatively correlated with temperature, and insect populations decreased following wanner years with a negative effect on the population trend. Results from this study suggest that warm spring-summer temperature can produce a within-year increase of breeding performance and voltinism of I. acuminatus, with a higher reproductive success of the first generation and the beginning of a large second one. In these cases there is, however, a between-years reduction of the population density probably due to a high winter mortality of the overwintering immature instars coming from an incomplete second generation.",yes,field,abundance,,,AGROCHIMICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0002-1857,NA,2014,NA,WOS:000342533100012

If enough suitable material is available in the forest, population density starts to grow and in lack of weakened trees the bark beetles attack healthy trees. In such circumstances this beetles are considered as primary pests. Regarding new problems with this bark beetle species in Croatia and trends of environmentally friendly forest protection measures, it is essential to determine the occurrence and possibilities of population spreading of the large larch bark beetle and gain new knowledge about possibilities for using pheromone traps against this pest. The results are showing occurrence, distribution and damage of large larch bark beetle in Croatia. Although large larch bark beetle has been mentioned in several publications as present in Croatia, there is no provable evidence of this because no locality has ever been given neither in publications nor entomological collections. Therefore the record of large larch bark beetle in Koprivnica on European larch (Larix decidua) in October 2008, could be considered as the first record of this pest species in Croatia. The large larch bark beetle was recorded from 2008 till 2013 at 24 forest sections in 7 Forest districts, in 23-58 old stands at elevation of 160-350 a.s.l.

The monitoring was observed trough the vegetation period from 2011 till 2013 which is the first pheromone trap monitoring of this species in Croatia. It was found that the first generation is swarming in middle April. Further only one generation was recorded till 2012 and just in 2013 a second generation occurred in August and September. The damage of this pest was assessed by number of marked trees and timber volume of felled trees. In total 4.922 larch trees were infected which is 2.121m3 timber volume. The majority of timber volume was marked for felling in 2012 and 2013 probably influenced by drought combined with high temperature and very long periods without precipitation. In such conditions larch trees were highly stressed and physiologically weakened. This was the trigger for bark beetle attack.

Using open-top warming chambers at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA, we manipulated temperature and presence of ants and Chaitophorus populicola aphids on Populus tremuloides host plants and monitored ant attendance and persistence of C. populicola, predator abundance, plant stress, and abundance of Myzus persicae, a pest aphid that colonized plants during the experiment. We found that, regardless of warming, C. populicola persistence was higher when tended by ants, and some ant species increased aphid persistence more than others. Warming had negligible direct but strong indirect effects on plant stress. Plant stress decreased with warming only when both ants and C. populicola aphids were present and engaged in mutualism. Plant stress was increased by warming-induced reductions in predator abundance and increases in M. persicae aphid abundance.

Increasing the temperature mean by 3 A degrees C predominantly affected developmental times, cold resistance and adult life span, while an increase in the diurnal temperature amplitude had very little effects. Immune function responded only weakly to different thermal regimes. The simulation of a prolonged heat wave severely impaired juvenile survival, body size and longevity, supporting the wide-held notion that extreme weather events will be much more important for species' performance and local survival than moderate increases in temperature means.

Several non-linear equations were fitted to the obtained data to model temperature-dependent population growth and species life history. The established equations for each life age/stage of the species were compiled to obtain an overall temperature-dependent phenology model. The life table parameters of P. solenopsis were estimated using stochastic simulation centred on a rate summation and cohort up-dating approach. The theoretical lower development threshold temperatures estimated using linear regressions applied to mean development rates were 11.2, 8.9, 9.8 and 12.7 degrees C, and the thermal constants for development were 93.7, 129.8, 97.1 and 100.0 degree days (DD) for nymph I, nymph 2, nymph 3 and male pupa stages, respectively. The developed phenology model predicted temperatures between 25 and 35 degrees C as the favourable range for P. solenopsis development, survival and reproduction. P. solenopsis population attained a maximum net reproductive rate (107-108 females/female/generation) and total fecundity (216.6-226.5 individuals/ female/generation) at temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees C. Mean length of generations decreased from 75.6 days at 15 degrees C to 21 days at 40 degrees C. The maximum finite rate of increase (1.12-1.16 females/female/ day) and shortest doubling time (4.3-6.1 days) were also observed at temperatures between 25 and 35 degrees C. The simulation of phenology model at fluctuating temperatures indicated that P. solenopsis populations might potentially increase with a finite rate of 1.06 females/female/day with an average generation time of 58.7 days and a doubling time of 12.1 days.

Trap trees are prepared in the summer to attract S. noctilio females to oviposit for later introduction of the nematode Beddingia siricidicola (Bedding), which is the biological control agent that has successfully managed populations of this exotic pest. In Australia, the bark beetle I. grandicollis has unprecedentedly been attacking these trap trees and the magnitude of the threat facing S. noctilio biocontrol as a result of attack by the bark beetle is unknown. Surveys for incidence of I. grandicollis in trap trees were conducted in four states of Australia - New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria - where P. radiata is grown commercially and S. noctilio biocontrol is important. Results showed that L grandicollis attack of trap trees is widespread and prevalent in South Australia, southern New South Wales and Victoria and absent in Tasmania. The incidence of L grandicollis in the trap trees was more severe in South Australia compared with New South Wales and Victoria. A more detailed analysis using New South Wales data examined the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in determining attack of trap trees by I. grandicollis in order to explain and allow prediction of the patterns of attack by the bark beetle and potential threat to S. noctilio biocontrol. The whole model accounted for 58.7% of the deviance; with the key predictors accounting for 46.3%. A linear regression model showed that maximum summer and winter temperatures, lower (0.5-1.9 m) soil moisture two years before the surveys, summer upper (0-0.7 m) soil moisture in the year of the surveys, autumn lower soil moisture in the year of survey, age of trap trees and damage to trees adjacent to trap tree plots are key predictors of L grandicollis attack on trap trees. Some of these driving factors were expected; others were unexpected or contradictory to our expectations. These factors would be important considerations when identifying locations where trap tree plots are established to reduce the impact of I. grandicollis on the S. noctilio biocontrol program.

The control of stored product pests and especially those of food products by manipulating temperature would be the best and safe choice. In this study, we examined the effects of temperature on developmental traits of E. cautella under laboratory conditions. For this study, newly hatched E. cautella larvae were reared at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C, with 65 +/- 5% relative humidity and a photoperiod of 15:9 (L:D). Biological parameters studied were: number and duration of larval instars; survival rate of larvae, pupae, and adults; total life span; and fecundity and fertility. Temperature had a significant impact on E. cautella development. At 5 degrees C, there was 100% mortality; eggs failed to hatch, and no larval or pupal survival was observed. On the other hand, E. cautella pupated after five larval instars at 25 degrees C while six instars were observed at 35 degrees C. The larval period significantly increased at 35 degrees C. However, total lifespan of both sexes was considerably longer at 25 degrees C. Of the three temperatures studied, 25 degrees C was highly favorable for fecundity, egg hatchability, and overall survival of all life stages.

Tillage, as a pervasive anthropogenic perturbation, also affects agricultural pests and their natural enemies in cropland systems. The effect of warming combined with tillage on tritrophic interactions is poorly known. A field experiment using infrared warming devices was conducted in conventional and no-tillage wheat fields in Northern China to examine the effects of warming and tillage on tritrophic interactions between winter wheat plants, aphids, and parasitoids. The results show that warming increased plant biomass and advanced plant phenology from re-greening to maturity by 6-11 days. No effects of tillage on plant phenology or biomass were found. Warming significantly increased the numbers of the aphid Sitobion avenae in 2010, when the parasitoid was scarce. Populations of S. avenae were 57.2% larger in warmed than in control plots. In 2011, aphid populations did not differ between warmed and control plots, but parasitoids were abundant, with approximately three times as many in warmed plots than in control ones. The rate of parasitism was also significantly increased in the warmed plots. Tillage had no significant effects on aphid and parasitoid populations in both years. These results indicate that the temperature-induced acceleration of winter wheat phenology resulted in increased aphid abundance. Warming strengthens the bottom-up and top-down effects. The response of parasitoids to warming varied according to their yearly population fluctuations, highlighting the need for a greater basic understanding of parasitoids and conservation of natural enemies.

The Central American locust, Schistocerca piceifrons is the most important locust species in the Americas, and it is distributed in zones of Mexico, Central and South America. In Mexico, despite the efforts to survey and monitor S. piceifrons (Walker) populations, outbreaks are still difficult to predict and prevent, and high economic and ecological costs are incurred in controlling them. The purpose of this study was to build a dynamic model of locust growth and development as a function of environmental conditions in order to identify suitable conditions for the high reproduction rates of this insect. This information can be used to assist in locust management. A modular approach and numerical integration techniques were applied in model building. The main inputs of the model were daily rainfall and temperature data, and physical soil properties such as texture and depth. The model estimates the growth of non-cultivated grass in breeding zones and oviposition rates as a function of soil moisture. The development rates of the different locust stages are calculated as a function of temperature. The model satisfactorily represents S. piceifrons behaviour, and generates 2 generations per yr, the first in summer and the second in winter. In locations with suboptimal temperatures the second generation does not complete development until the next year.

Here, we explore how thermal biology affects the population abundance of two globally significant pest fruit fly species, Ceratitis capitata (medfly) and C. rosa (Natal fruit fly), including irradiated individuals and those expressing a temperature sensitive lethal (tsl) mutation that are used in the sterile insect technique. Results show that upper and lower lethal temperatures are seldom encountered at the field sites, while critical minimum temperatures for activity and lower developmental thresholds are crossed more frequently. Estimates of abundance revealed that C. capitata are active year-round, but abundance declines markedly during winter. Temporal autocorrelation of average fortnightly trap captures and of development time, estimated from an integrated model to calculate available degree days, show similar seasonal lags suggesting that population increases in early spring occur after sufficient degree-days have accumulated. By contrast, population collapses coincide tightly with increasing frequency of low temperature events that fall below critical minimum temperatures for activity. Individuals of C. capitata expressing the tsl mutation show greater critical thermal maxima and greater longevity under field conditions than reference individuals. Taken together, this evidence suggests that low temperatures limit populations in the Western Cape, South Africa and likely do so elsewhere. Increasing temperature extremes and warming climates generally may extend the season over which these species are active, and could increase abundance. The sterile insect technique may prove profitable as climates change given that laboratory-reared tsl flies have an advantage under warmer conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Gray, DR",The influence of forest composition and climate on outbreak characteristics of the spruce budworm in eastern Canada,"The spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens) is perhaps the single most important disturbance agent in Canada's eastern forests. Climate and forest composition are dominant factors in spruce budworm outbreak dynamics through their direct influences on the pest, its natural enemies, and its hosts, and through their influence on the multitrophic interactions that are important in outbreak dynamics. A combination of four climate variables, three forest composition variables, and one location variable explained 60% of the multivariate variability in outbreak characteristics (duration and severity) in eastern Canada. Outbreak duration was most strongly influenced by April-May accumulation of degree-days; outbreak severity was most strongly influenced by the extreme maximum temperatures of April-May. The basal area of balsam fir had a stronger influence than that of black spruce on duration and on severity. Both outbreak characteristics declined in more northerly locations. Under a projected future (2011-2040) climate scenario the largest increases in outbreak duration and severity are predicted to occur on the Gaspe Peninsula and the north shore of the St. Lawrence River (Quebec). The largest decreases in duration and severity are predicted to occur in southern Ontario and along the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The predicted average change in outbreak duration is around -1.3 years.

Although the distributional range of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera Notodontidae) appears to be expanding northward and upslope with climate warming, the relative importance of climate and endogenous, density-dependent factors has not been clearly documented. We analyzed the population dynamics of the moth using long-term data from two provinces in the Southern Alps (Trento: 1990-2009, Bolzano/Bozen: 1975-2011) to evaluate the relative importance of climate and density-dependent factors as regional drivers. Both summer temperatures and rainfall significantly affected population growth rate, with different outcomes depending on the local conditions. Although previous studies indicated that low winter temperatures have negative effects on insect performance, our analyses did not show any negative effect on the population dynamics. A negative density dependent feedback with a 1-year lag emerged as the most important factor driving the population dynamics in both regions. Potential mechanisms explaining the observed negative density feedback include deterioration of host quality, increased mortality caused by pathogens, and increase of prolonged diapause as an adaptive mechanism to escape adverse conditions.",yes,field,abundance,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0165-0009,1573-1480,2013,10.1007/s10584-013-0966-2,WOS:000327395700010

This study was conducted in a rubber tree/coffee plant interface that was influenced by the trees to a varying degrees depending on the location of the coffee plants, i.e. from beneath the rubber trees, extending through a range of distances from the edge of the tree plantation to end in a coffee monocrop field. The most severe damage inflicted on coffee plants by the CLM (number of mined leaves) from April, which marks the start of the water deficit period, until September 2003 was in the zone close to the rubber trees, whereas the damage inflicted on plants in the monocropped field was comparable to that on coffee plants grown directly beneath the rubber trees, which received about 25-40 % of the available irradiance (I-r-available irradiation at a certain position divided by the irradiation received in full sunlight, i.e. in the monocrop). From May until July damage caused by the CLM nearly doubled in each month. In midwinter (July), the damage decreased perceptibly from the tree edge toward the open field. From September onward, with the rising air temperatures CLM damage in the coffee monocrop started to increase. Based on these results, we conclude that coffee plants grown in the full sun incurred the most damage only at the end of winter, with warming air temperatures. Coffee plants grown in shadier locations (25-40 % I-r) were less damaged by the CLM, although a higher proportion of their leaves were mined. The rubber trees probably acted as a shelter during the cold autumn and winter seasons, leading to greater CLM damage over a distance outside the rubber tree plantation that was about equal to the height of the trees.

Additionally, the interactive effects of multiple factors associated with climate change such as elevated temperature (eT) and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) are untested.

Sitona discoideus larvae feed on root nodules housing N-2-fixing rhizobial bacteria, allowing us to test the effects of eT and eCO(2) across trophic levels. Moreover, we assessed the influence of these factors on plant growth. eT increased plant growth rate initially (6, 8 and 10 weeks after sowing), with cultivar Sequel achieving the greatest height.

Effects of eT and eCO(2) on root nodulation were mirrored by weevil larval development; eT and eCO(2) reduced and increased larval development, respectively. Contrary to expectations, aphid colonization was unaffected by eT or eCO(2), but there was a near-significant 10% reduction in colonization rates on plants with weevils present belowground.

A thermal constant-based mechanistic-hemimetabolous-population model was adapted for BPH and linked with InfoCrop, a crop simulation model to simulate climate change impact on both the pest population and crop-pest interactions.

A low parental temperature resulted in female offspring that developed faster at low developmental temperature compared with females whose parents were reared at high temperature. Furthermore, females whose parents were reared at low temperature were heavier and more fecund and had better flight abilities than females whose parents were reared at high temperature. In addition to these cross-generational effects, females developed at low temperature had similar flight abilities at low and high ambient temperatures, whereas females developed at high temperature had poorer flight abilities at low than at high ambient temperature. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced benefit of low parental temperature on offspring performance, as well as between- and within-generation effects of acclimation to low temperature. In cooler environments, the offspring generation is expected to develop more rapidly than the parental generation and to comprise more fecund and more dispersive females. By producing phenotypes that are adaptive to the conditions inducing them as well as heritable, cross-generational plasticity can influence the evolutionary trajectory of populations. The potential for short-term acclimation to low temperature may allow expanding insect populations to better cope with novel environments and may help to explain the spread and establishment of invasive species.",yes,experimental,laboratory,fecundity,,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1010-061X,1420-9101,2013,10.1111/jeb.12218,WOS:000325983400003
J,"Walsh, GC; Sacco, J; Mattioli, F",Voltinism of Diabrotica speciosa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in Argentina: latitudinal clines and implications for damage anticipation,"BackgroundDiabrotica speciosa (Germar) is an important pest in South America. Both the adults and the larvae are polyphagous, and its most susceptible host is maize. Factors behind the appearance of adults in the field and geographical variations in voltinism are unknown. This hinders the chances of implementing rational control strategies. ResultsThis study compiles field collection data from four agricultural regions of Argentina to examine the number of generations and phenology of D. speciosa in the field. These data are correlated with climatic data in order to provide evidence of regional variations and probable environmental causes for the appearance of adult generations in the field. Results indicate that temperature has an important role in the appearance of new generations in the temperate distribution areas of D. speciosa, but not within its subtropical range, where teneral adults appeared all year round. ConclusionResults suggest that the emergence of adults may be elicited by weekly average temperatures above 13 degrees C. In the temperate distribution areas of D. speciosa there could be at least three generations a year, and in the subtropical region at least five. No obvious or discrete voltinism pattern could be observed for D. speciosa in southern South America.

In the temperature integration approach, considerable daily temperature variations are allowed, which not only have an important influence on plant growth but also on the development rate of arthropods in the crop. Therefore, we examined the influence of two constant temperature regimes (15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C and 20 A degrees C/20 A degrees C) and one alternating temperature regime (20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C, with an average of 15 A degrees C) on life table parameters of Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus and their target pest, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae at a 16:8 (L:D) h photoperiod and 65 +/- A 5 % RH. For females of both predatory mites the alternating temperature regime resulted in a 25-30 % shorter developmental time as compared to the corresponding mean constant temperature regime of 15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C. The immature development of female spider mites was prolonged for 7 days at 15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C as compared to 20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C. With a daytime temperature of 20 A degrees C, no differences in lifetime fecundity were observed between a nighttime temperature of 20 and 5 A degrees C for P. persimilis and T. urticae. The two latter species did show a higher lifetime fecundity at 20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C than at 15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C, and their daily fecundity at the alternating regime was about 30 % higher than at the corresponding mean constant temperature. P. persimilis and T. urticae showed no differences in sex ratio between the three temperature regimes, whereas the proportion of N. californicus females at 15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C (54.2 %) was significantly lower than that at 20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C (69.4 %) and 20 A degrees C/20 A degrees C (67.2 %). Intrinsic rates of increase were higher at the alternating temperature than at the corresponding mean constant temperature for both pest and predators.

Estimations of the habitat distribution and population growth rates of D. citri are required to establish regional and area-wide management strategies and can be used as a pest risk analysis tools. In this study, the habitat distribution of D. citri in Mexico was computed with MaxEnt, an inductive, machine-learning program that uses bioclimatic layers and point location data. Geographic distributions of development and population growth rates were determined by fitting a temperature-dependent, non-linear model and projecting the rates over the target area, using the annual mean temperature as the predictor variable. The results showed that the most suitable regions for habitat of D. citri comprise the Gulf of Mexico states, Yucatan Peninsula, and areas scattered throughout the Pacific coastal states. Less suitable areas occurred in northern and central states. The most important predictor variables were related to temperature. Development and growth rates had a distribution wider than habitat, reaching some of the northern states of Mexico. Habitat, development, and population growth rates were correlated to each other and with the citrus producing area.

To determine the effect of temperature on A. lepigone growth, and to provide a forecasting model for this pest, the development and fecundity of A. lepigone under five different temperatures (18, 21, 24, 27, 30 degrees C) was investigated, and an experimental population life table was constructed based on the obtained results. The results showed that the duration of development of A. lepigone decreased as the temperature increased from 18 to 30 degrees C. Approximately 95% of mature larvae stopped pupating at 18 degrees C, and about 70% of mature larvae stopped pupating at 21 degrees C. When the growth chamber temperature was above 24 degrees C, no growth arrest was observed. The results indicated that the optimum growth temperature of A. lepigone was about 26.47 degrees C. In this study, the highest survival rate, fecundity per female, and population index trend were observed when the temperature was set at 27 degrees C. The percentages of larvae that could spin cocoons after the 5th or 6th instar differed at the different temperatures. The developmental threshold temperatures for A. lepigone eggs, larvae, pre-pupae, pupae, pre-oviposition females, and the whole generation (i.e., egg to oviposition) were 11.03, 9.04, 15.08, 11.79, 11.63, and 10.84 degrees C, respectively, and their effective accumulative temperatures were 63.51, 339.42, 30.04, 118.41, 35.06 and 574.08 degree-days, respectively.

Sitotroga cerealella are routinely exposed to temperatures below 20 degrees C in regions of the U.S. where corn is grown, yet there are no data describing adult life history parameters below 20 degrees C. We determined longevity, fecundity, and survivorship of eggs at a range of temperatures that represent environmental conditions to which S. cerealella are exposed in corn stored in the U.S. Longest male longevity was 31 d at 10 degrees C, and shortest male longevity was 4 d at 35 and 40 degrees C. Longest female longevity was 29 d at 15 degrees C, and shortest female longevity was 5 days at 35 and 40 degrees C. Duration of the preoviposition period was as long as 16 d at 10 degrees C and as short as 1 d at 30-40 degrees C. All females laid eggs at 20-30 degrees C, 50-94% of females laid eggs at 15 degrees C, and 17-61% of females laid eggs at 10, 35, or 40 degrees C.

In this study, we explored the active flight potential of S. mosellana under various environmental factors using a 26-channel computer-monitored flight mill system. The most suitable temperature for flight and flight distance was 16-24 degrees C; flight duration peaked at 16 degrees C while speed peaked at 28 degrees C. Flight performance gradually declined between 10 and 400 lux light intensity. More than 50% individuals of 1-d-old females flew >500 m, while only 24% of males flew >500 m. One-day-old S. mosellana had stronger flight ability than that of 2-d-old individuals.

However, sufficiently long time series in ecology are scarce. The research presented here analyzes a long-term data set collected by the Hungarian Forest Research Institute over the period 1961-2009. The number of hectares with visible defoliation was estimated and documented for several forest insect pest species. This resulted in a unique time series that provides us with the opportunity to compare insect damage trends with trends in weather patterns. Data were analyzed for six lepidopteran species: Thaumetopoea processionea, Tortrix viridana, Rhyacionia buoliana, Malacosoma neustria, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, and Lymantria dispar. All these species exhibit outbreak dynamics in Hungary. Five of these species prefer deciduous tree species as their host plants, whereas R.buoliana is a specialist on Pinus spp. The data were analyzed using general linear models and generalized least squares regression in relation to mean monthly temperature and precipitation. Temperature increased considerably, especially over the last 25years (+1.6 degrees C), whereas precipitation exhibited no trend over the period. No change in weather variability over time was observed. There was increased damage caused by two species on deciduous trees. The area of damage attributed to R.buoliana decreased over the study period. There was no evidence of increased variability in damage. We conclude that species exhibiting a trend toward outbreak-level damage over a greater geographical area may be positively affected by changes in weather conditions coinciding with important life stages. Strong associations between the geographical extent of severe damage and monthly temperature and precipitation are difficult to confirm, studying the life-history traits of species could help to increase understanding of responses to climate change.",yes,field,damage,,,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2045-7758,NA,2013,10.1002/ece3.717,WOS:000326286700012

This species has a history, in Estonia, of less than 50 years. Due to their great ability to adapt to variable environmental conditions, the beetles spread very quickly throughout the country and established a permanent population in the 1980s. Before 2010, CPB has been predominantly univoltine. The occurrence of the second generation was the result of rare coincidence of extremely favourable weather as the cumulative degree days (DD) of 927 exceeded the sum needed for two full generations. Constantly high temperatures from the beginning of May caused the formation of summer generation adults already by the end of July and the long day photoperiod, as well the availability of fresh food, kept the beetles in reproductive mode preventing the onset of diapause. Summer beetles continued to oviposit up to the second half of September, but a large proportion of the second generation was eliminated from the population in the pre-adult or adult stages as they failed to end their development in the favourable period. Successful overwintering with about 50% survivors occurred only in association with completed development which was restricted to August and the beginning of September.

Hyphantria cunea larvae are noted generalists, and have been recorded feeding on dozens of plant families worldwide. There appear to be at least two forms of H. cunea that are distinguished by the larval head capsule color: black or red. Most previous accounts of H. cunea in the literature focus on the black-headed form. The three goals of the research we present here are to 1) detail successful rearing techniques for the red-headed form of H. cunea, 2) describe life history traits of red-headed H. cunea in Colorado and 3) test whether female pupal mass predicts potential fecundity for H. cunea as well as other lepidopteran species. Our data are compiled from two years of rearing experiments in the lab.

Field studies were conducted to determine the effect of the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, on marketable yield of strawberries during the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 growing seasons. Low, medium, and high mite infestation levels were established by initial inoculations of 5, 10, and 20 twospotted spider mites per strawberry leaf, respectively. A control treatment maintained at near zero mites through applications of an acaricide, bifenazate (Acramite 50 WP), was also included. Weekly records of motile twospotted spider mites were obtained over 13 and 16 wk during the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 growing seasons, respectively. Degree-days and weather parameters were monitored to determine their effect on mite population. In addition, mite-days were calculated for each year from weekly mite counts to determine the effect of mites on marketable yield of strawberries. In both years, twospotted spider mite population increased throughout the growing seasons. More degree-days were accumulated during the 2008/2009 growing season, and mite population was higher in 2008/2009 than in 2009/2010. Mite population density per leaf increased up to 278 motiles per leaf in 2008/2009 growing season as compared with 137 in 2009/2010 within the high-infestation-level treatment. The divergence in mite population between the two growing seasons was attributed mainly to temperature differences between the two seasons that affected mite population development and establishment. During both growing seasons, the high mite infestation level had lowest marketable yield. A negative correlation between cumulative mite-days and harvested marketable yields was detected in both seasons, but it was only significant during the 2008/2009 growing season. Strawberry yield reduction was detected when plants attained 80 mites per leaf in 2008/2009 and 50 mites per leaf in 2009/2010 within the high mite infestation treatment.

Knowledge of their activity in spring is important for nursery growers to effectively time their protective sprays. We measured the reliability of ethanol-baited bottle traps for monitoring emergence of overwintered Xylosandrus spp. in ornamental nurseries. Detection of initial flight activity by traps was compared with initial attacks on ethanol-injected trap trees. To develop tools for forecasting Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford) activity, the relationships between temperature and their attack and flight activity were examined, and the bloom sequence of ornamental plants was examined as phenological indicators of X. germanus emergence in Ohio. Captures of X. germanus coincided with attacks on trap trees on seven of eight occasions over 2 yr in four nurseries. Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motshulsky) were detected in only one nursery and captures coincided with attacks each year. There was a strong relationship between maximum daily temperatures 20 and 21 degrees C and X. germanus attack and flight activity. No attack or flight activity were detected in a monitoring period unless there were 1 or 2 d of at least 20 degrees C. Emergence of X. germanus always began after and within 6 d of full bloom on Cornelian cherry dogwood, and usually after and within 4 d of first bloom on Norway maple and full bloom on border forsythia.

The predators were also monitored using beating trays. The phenology of egg laying and damage by apple leafcurling midge, and the adult numbers of its egg parasitoid Platygaster demades, were recorded on Royal Gala' apples from 1997 to 2000 at the same location. Apple leafcurling midge completed three to four generations per year depending on summer temperatures, with greatest larval damage by the second generation in December/January, particularly to terminal and lateral shoots. Although each apple cultivar was planted in a discrete block, there were large differences in damage which persisted over several seasons, suggesting significant variation in cultivar susceptibility. Colonisation of the trees by P. demades was slow but monitoring of adult numbers indicated good synchronisation with midge egg laying from the 1998-99 season. Both predatory bug species occurred at higher density on midge-damaged shoots than on undamaged shoots. Analysis of midge damage in relation to the population density of the bugs indicated that midge damage fell in response to high densities of S. albisignata and was high only when this species was at low density. On the other hand, O. vicinus appeared to be a minor predator because higher densities of O. vicinus were correlated with higher midge damage and there was no evidence that this led to a later reduction in the midge population.

However, a single treatment in June would be sufficient when in this last period the maximum daily temperatures were higher than 27 degrees C for at least 15 days, avoiding in this way the harmful effects of imidacloprid on predators.",yes,field,abundance,,,SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1695-971X,2171-9292,2013,10.5424/sjar/2013112-2961,WOS:000320489100026

C. tujafilina was reared in a laboratory on T. orientalis at five constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 28A degrees C, 70% humidity and 14L:10D. The pre-reproduction stage varied from 7 at 25A degrees C to 19 days at 10A degrees C. Developmental threshold was assigned at 3.5A degrees C. The longest reproduction stage for the aphids developing was recorded at 25A degrees C, namely 33 days, while the shortest, at the temperature of 10A degrees C, lasted 8 days. At 25A degrees C this species is characterised by the shortest pre-reproduction stage, the highest fecundity, the highest survival rate and the highest demographic parameters, particularly r(m) (0.17).

Such understanding is important, not least, when trying to predict the future impact of pest insects. In this study, it was reported how the multiple effects of temperature, photoperiod, and food quality affected the survival, development, and the final weight of the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr.), an herbivorous outbreak species in boreal pine (Pinus spp.) forests. Sawfly larvae were reared in two different temperatures (15 and 20 degrees C) and under two different light regimes (20 and 18 h light). The larvae were fed pine needles either low or high in diterpene content. A 5 degrees C higher temperature did not affect the survival of the larvae, but reduced the development time by 3741%. The final weight was reduced by 22% in the warmer temperature, but only in combination with a short day length. A high content of diterpenes in the needles reduced the susceptibility to the virus by 31%, but did not otherwise affect the performance of the larvae. This study shows that the larval development could be shortened in a warmer climate and thereby decreasing the risk of predation. This per se may increase the risk for insect outbreaks, but the interactive effects of warmer temperatures with other abiotic and biotic factors such as day length and food quality (indicated in this study), and potential better performance of natural enemies and pathogens, illustrate the possibility for complex outcomes in a climate change perspective.",no,,,,,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0307-6946,1365-2311,2013,10.1111/een.12005,WOS:000316216400009

Here, we combined approaches developed by two conceptual frameworks in ecology, the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH), and the biodiversityecosystem functioning relationship (B-EF), to test the hypothesis that interspecific difference in thermal performance modulates multiple species interactions along a thermal stress (SGH) and the subsequent richness effects on process rates (B-EF). We designed an experiment using three species of herbivorous agricultural pests with different thermal optima for which we determined how temperature influences the direction and the strength of interaction and subsequent richness effects on crop damage (7 species interaction treatmentsx6 temperature treatmentsx10 replicates). We showed that both biotic interactions and species richness effects drive variations in crop damages along a thermal stress gradient, and thus have the potential to drive agro-system responses to climate change. To help explain and generalize underlying mechanisms of richness effects on process rates, we further proposed a conceptual model that views interaction outcomes as shifting between positive and negative along a thermal stress depending on species thermal optima. Overall, our study demonstrates that nonlinear effects of temperature on process rates must be a major concern in terms of prediction and management of the consequences of global warming.",yes,experimental,laboratory,consumption,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,1365-2486,2013,10.1111/gcb.12104,WOS:000315900800008

Here we seek to understand how abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change can affect plant-herbivore interactions in a model crop species (soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr.) by answering three questions: (1) Do the combined effects of abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change cause synergistic negative effects on plant biomass? (2) Can abiotic stress affect resistance of plants to insect herbivores? (3) Does genetic variation in plant traits modify a plant's response to stress? We performed three experiments in controlled growth environments using up to 51 soybean genotypes selected to vary in numerous traits associated with drought and resistance against pests (e.g., insect herbivores, nematodes, and pathogenic fungi), and up to 3 generalist-feeding herbivorous noctuid moth species (Helicoverpa zea, Heliothis virescens, and Spodoptera exigua) that commonly feed on soybean in North America. Drought and herbivory had the largest and the most consistent negative effects on plant performance, reducing the above- and below-ground biomass by 10-45 %, whereas increased temperature had little to no effect on plants. Drought also increased susceptibility to generalist noctuid herbivores, but these results varied dramatically in magnitude and direction among plant genotypes. Our experiments show that the effects of abiotic and biotic stress on soybean biomass were largely due to the additive effects of these stresses, and there exists substantial genetic variation in the soybean germplasm pool we studied that could be used as a source of parental stock in breeding new crops that can more effectively tolerate and resist the combined negative effects of insect herbivory and drought.",yes,experimental,greenhouse,abundance,,ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1872-8855,1872-8847,2013,10.1007/s11829-012-9234-z,WOS:000316822500008

For many species, this type of analysis is hampered by datasets that contain a large proportion of zeros, and data that are overdispersed and spatially autocorrelated. This is particularly true for insects, for which abundance data can fluctuate from zero to many thousands in the space of weeks. Increasingly, an understanding of the ways in which environmental variation drives spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution, abundance and phenology of insects is required for management of pests and vector-borne diseases. In this study, we combine the use of smoothing techniques and generalised linear mixed models to relate environmental drivers to key phenological patterns of two species of biting midges, Culicoides pulicaris and C. impunctatus, of which C. pulicaris has been implicated in transmission of bluetongue in Europe. In so doing, we demonstrate analytical tools for linking the phenology of species with key environmental drivers, despite using a relatively small dataset containing overdispersed and zero-inflated data.

Herbivorous arthropod Pests are often more abundant in urban than in rural areas,. and urban outbreaks have been attributed to reduced control by predators and parasitoids and to increased susceptibility of stressed urban plants. These hypotheses, however, leave many outbreaks unexplained and fail to predict variation in pest abundance within cities. Here we show that the abundance of a common insect pest is positively related to temperature even when controlling for other habitat characteristics The scale insect Parthenolecanium quercifex was 13 times more abundant on willow oak trees in the hottest parts of Raleigh, NC, in the southeastern United States, than in cooler areas, though parasitism rates were similar. We further separated the effects of heat from those of natural enemies and plant quality in a greenhouse reciprocal transplant experiment. P. quercifex collected from hot urban trees became more abundant in hot greenhouses than in cool greenhouses, whereas the abundance of P. quercifex collected from cooler urban trees remained low in hot and cool greenhouses. Parthenolecanium quercifex living in urban hot spots succeed with warming, and they do so because some demes have either acclimatized or adapted to high temperatures. Our results provide the first evidence that heat can be a key driver of insect pest outbreaks on urban trees. Since urban warming is similar in magnitude to global warming predicted in the next 50 years, pest abundance on city trees may foreshadow widespread outbreaks as natural forests also grow warmer.",yes,field,abundance,,,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1932-6203,NA,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0059687,WOS:000317480700047
J,"Berec, L; Dolezal, P; Hais, M",Population dynamics of Ips typographus in the Bohemian Forest (Czech Republic): Validation of the phenology model PHENIPS and impacts of climate change,"Phenology models play an important role in insect ecology and pest management. For bark beetle species prone to frequent outbreaks, they help predict swarming periods, discern sister generations hard to recognize in the field yet indispensable in studies of bark beetle population dynamics, predict the extent to which the generations entering diapause develop, as well as help address the omnipresent issue of impacts of climate change. As a prerequisite to developing a simulation model of landscape-level forest disturbances in the Bohemian Forest, including those due to Ips typographus, we validate the phenology model PHENIPS, published in the literature and simulating seasonal development of this species, by data coming from this region. We find a reasonable agreement between the modeled and actually observed bark beetle dynamics, thus strengthening the potential role of PHENIPS in any future attempt to model dynamics of Central European populations of I. typographus. In addition, we use PHENIPS to assess impacts of climate change on temperature-regulated phenology of L typographus. In contrast to previous studies which used regional climate models to predict future temperature development, we independently account for changes in the mean air temperature and in the frequency of extreme weather events - for the latter, we assume that the inter-annual air temperature variance will also increase. Since bark beetle development is driven by bark temperatures and both low and high bark temperatures inhibit the development, we find that the effects of increases in the air temperature mean and variance are compensatory. Hence, if climate is to change so that both these characteristics grow, we expect only a relatively minor change in generation development time. Moreover, initiation of the third filial generation of L typographus in the Bohemian Forest is predicted to occur only for relatively large shifts in the mean air temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The hypothesis of our present study was that the future distribution and abundance (damage potential) of this pest will be greatly affected by climate-change-caused changes in temperature. We used a process-based climatic phenology model for P. operculella and applied three risk indices (establishment-, generation, and activity index) in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to map and quantify changes for climate change scenarios of the year 2050 based on downscaled climate-change data of the scenario A1B from the WorldClim database. All applications and simulations were made using the Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software recently developed by The International Potato Center, Lima, Peru. The study concludes that there are three possible main scenarios of changes that may simultaneously occur: (1) the P. operculella damage potential will progressively increase in all regions where the pest already prevails today with an excessive increase in warmer cropping regions of the tropics and subtropics. In regions where P. operculella is established and develops >4 generations per year, economic losses are likely to occur; under the current climate, >4 generations are developed on 30.1% of the total potato production area worldwide, which will increase until the year 2050 to 42.4%, equal to an increase of 2,409,974 ha of potato under new infestation. (2) A range expansion in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere with additionally 8.6% (699,680 ha), 4.2% (32,873 ha), and 2.7% (234,404 ha) of the potato production area under higher risk in Asia, North America, and Europe, with moderate increases of its damage potential. (3) A range expansion in tropical temperate mountainous regions with a moderate increase of its damage potential; e.g., in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru 44,281 ha, 9569 ha, and 39,646 ha of potato will be under new risk of infestation. The ILCYM software allowed a detailed analysis of possible climate-change-induced changes in temperature on P. operculella distribution and damage potential. Further, this tool offers means of overcoming limitations in predictions and mapping experienced with climate data interpolation and resolution by spatial point-by-point simulations at locations of interest.

Using a molecular identification system, 1348 field-collected larvae from 85 sites were identified to species-level. Three species, Agriotes obscurus, Agriotes brevis, Agriotes ustulatus, and two that could not be discerned molecularly (Agriotes lineatus and Agriotes proximus), were assigned to two ecological groups: (i) A. brevis/A. ustulatus, found in areas with a warmer, drier climate and alkaline soils, and (ii) A. obscurus/A. lineatus/proximus which occur mainly at higher altitude characterised by lower temperatures, higher precipitation and acidic, humus-rich soils. Agriotes sputator was abundant throughout Austria, confirming its euryoecious nature. Only one larva of Agriotes litigiosus was found, prohibiting further analysis. These data contribute to a characterisation of species-specific traits in Agriotes larvae in agricultural land, an important prerequisite to develop efficient control strategies for these wireworms.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1612-4758,NA,2013,10.1007/s10340-011-0393-y,WOS:000315350100005

Results indicated that the developmental periods of D. neobrevipes females (from the first instar nymph to adult) shortened from 55.4 days at 17 degrees C to 16.9 days at 29 degrees C, while the males' decreased from 54.0 days at 17 degrees C to 15.8 days at 32 degrees C. The highest survivorship of D. neobrevipes from the first instar nymph to adult was recorded at 29 degrees C; 88.8% for females and 89.2% for males. The average longevity of females was 95.0 days at 17 degrees C, but decreased to 30.0 days at 26 degrees C. This was still significantly longer than those of males; 5.6 days at 17 degrees C and 2.3 days at 32 degrees C.

The insect population community was monitored in the safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) field located in research farm of National Agriculture Research Centre, Islamabad. The data were recorded weekly by visual count method on randomly selected whole plant basis at seedling vegetative stage, and maturity of five varieties of safflower including SAF-31, SAF-32, SAF-35, SAF-38 and THORI-78. Population dynamics of four insect genera including jassid (Amrasca bigutella bigutella), aphid (Uroleucon carthami), lygus bug (Lygus Hesperus K) and pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera Hub.); and two beneficial insect genera named green lacewing (Chrysoperla chornea) and ladybird beetle (Coccinella septempunctata Linn.) were monitored. The data revealed that among the safflower varieties SAF-38, THORI-78, SAF-31 and SAF-38 carried maximum population of jassid, aphids, bug and pod borer, respectively. Highly significant differences in population build up was evident at monitoring dates. Population percentage of aphid (85%) was highest followed by bug (4.2%), jassid (2.79%), pod borer (2.56%), green lacewing (1.01%) and ladybird beetle (0.60%). The aphid populations on all five varieties showed significantly positive correlation with temperature but negative correlation with relative humidity.

We set eight constant temperatures from 18 to 32 degrees C in 2 degrees C-increments to check the effect of temperature on the developmental rate of this insect species. The developmental durations of eggs and nymphs were observed daily. To ensure the accuracy of developmental durations, 500 initial samples were taken for the nymphal stage at each temperature. Performance-2 model was used to fit these data because this model can provide the lower and upper developmental thresholds simultaneously. The estimate of lower developmental thresholds of eggs (10.0 degrees C) was different from that of nymphs (7.5 degrees C). And the estimate of upper developmental thresholds of eggs (35.5 degrees C) was also different from that of nymphs (30.2 degrees C). However, for male and female nymphs, the difference in the lower developmental threshold is nonsignificant, and the difference in the upper developmental thresholds is very small (95% confidence interval of the difference: [0.007 degrees C, 0.043 degrees C]). The rate isomorphy hypothesis considers that the lower developmental thresholds of different stages for the same insect might be constant. However, the current study provides a counterexample of this hypothesis that the lower developmental threshold of eggs is different from that of nymphs. Thus, we demonstrate that the rate isomorphy hypothesis does not apply all insects. In addition, we used a popular nonlinear model, Lactin model, to fit the developmental rate data of our experiment. And we found that the estimates of lower and upper developmental thresholds by using Performance-2 model were very approximate to those by using Lactin model.

Females (1.54 +/- 0.03 g) weighed signi_cantly more than males (1.12 +/- 0.03 g), but the average weights of the beetles emerging in each temperature did not differ. Adult weight was positively correlated with exit hole diameter (diameter[mm] = 2.2 * weight [g] + 7.9). The rate at which beetles bored through the wood (136, 178, and 168 mm(3)/d at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively) significantly differed between temperatures but did not differ with beetle weight. Temperature had a significant effect on the time it took adults to initiate boring (7, 5, and 4 d at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, respectively) and subsequently to complete boring to emerge (5, 4, and 4 d at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, respectively).

Accurate models describing the relationships between temperature and development of L. hesperus would facilitate the study of Lygus seasonal population dynamics and overwintering ecology. We used nonlinear biophysical models to describe the development of L. hesperus eggs oviposited in green bean pods and semitransparent agarose and held under constant temperatures from 10 to 37.8 degrees C. The agarose substrate was used because it is less susceptible than green beans to deterioration at low and high temperature extremes, and because it allowed the observation of phases of embryonic development that are hidden from view from eggs developing in plant material. The models indicated that both low and high temperature inhibited development of each observed embryonic phase regardless of oviposition substrate. Developmental rates asymptotically approached zero with decreasing temperature in the lower thermal range, and decreased with increasing temperatures above 32.2 degrees C. Eggs oviposited in agarose developed slower than eggs oviposited in green bean pods suggesting that egg developmental rates were influenced by the type of host substrate.

Experiments were carried out from September 2005 to July 2007, using 25 pitfall traps baited with food grade oil and pheromone specific for Sitophilus spp. The traps were observed weekly and the insects were identified and counted. Several species were found but Sitophilus zeamais and Sitophilus oryzae were the most abundant (90% of the total) followed by Tribolium castaneum. Taylor's power law parameters, from the regression of log variance versus log mean, suggest an aggregated distribution for Sitophilus spp. and T castaneum. A fixed-precision sequential sampling plan was developed for Sitophilus spp., using Green's fixed precisions sampling plan and the Resampling Validation of Sampling Plan, with an action threshold of 0.5 Sitophilus spp. The sampling plan was designed to provide precision levels of 0.20, 0.25 (for pest management purposes), 0.30 and 0.35. The current sample size raised a precision of 030, and an increase of the number of traps to 37 would be needed to achieve the desirable precision of 0.25.

It causes damage in SE France and Italy, where it was accidentally introduced. In Spain information is scarce and, moreover, almost nothing is known about the predators of this species. This study was designed to determine the seasonal trends in abundance of M. feytaudi and its major predators, which might help to improve the biological control of this pest in other areas. Natural P. pinaster stands in the Valencian Community (Spain) were surveyed in 2004. In addition, the seasonal trends in abundance of M. feytaudi and its natural enemies were monitored in three stands over a period of three years (2002, 2005 and 2006). The monitoring was carried by wrapping sticky tapes around tree trunks and using delta traps baited with sexual pheromone. The maritime pine bast scale was detected in all the stands surveyed. At almost all the sites surveyed, three species of predators were captured: Elatophilus nigricornis Zetterstedt (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), Hemerobius stigma Stephens (Neuroptera: Hemerobiidae) and Malachiomimus pectinatus (Kiesenwetter) (Coleoptera: Malachiidae). The presence of M. pectinatus is noteworthy as this is the first record of this species as a possible predator of M. feytaudi. The results show that M. feytaudi, although differing in its phenology depending on the location, is univoltine in the study area. The prepupae, pupae and adults of M. feytaudi appeared between December and March in colder areas and between October and February in warmer areas. E. nigricornis nymphs are important predators of M. feytaudi, and were abundant when the scale insect (crawlers, prepupae, pupae, male and female adults) was present. The flight period of E. nigricornis and the hemerobiid H. stigma ranged from May to October. However, these flight patterns did not correlate with the presence of the different stages of the bast scale (crawlers, prepupae, pupae, male and female adults) on the surface of tree trunks. The presence of M. pectinatus in large numbers in some stands suggests it might be an important natural regulator, which helps to keep M. feytaudi populations at low densities in the areas of Spain studied.

In order to simulate the future climate conditions one of the most frequently used A1B SRES scenarios and two different IPCC climate models (HadCM3 and GISS modelE) are considered. A daily weather generator (WGENK) was used to generate temperature values for present and future climate conditions (time horizons 2020-2040 and 2040-2060). Based on the generated data set, the degree-days values were then calculated and the emergence dates of the codling moth at key stages were estimated basing on the defined thresholds. Our analyses showed that the average air surface temperature in the Wielkopolska region may increase from 2.8A degrees C (according to GISS modelE) even up to 3.3A degrees C (HadCM3) in the period of 2040-2060. With the warming climate conditions the cumulated degree-days values may increase at a rate of about 142 DD per decade when the low temperature threshold (T (low) ) of 0A degrees C is considered and 91 DD per decade when T (low) = 10A degrees C. The key developmental stages of the codling moth may occur much earlier in the future climate conditions than currently, at a rate of about 3.8-6.8 days per decade, depending on the considered GCM model and the pest developmental stage. The fastest changes may be observed in the emergence dates of 95% of larvae of the second codling moth generation. This could increase the emergence probability of the pest third generation that has not currently occurred in Poland.",no,,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0020-7128,1432-1254,2013,10.1007/s00484-012-0531-0,WOS:000312722200003

In the region of study, the species had two generations a year: a spring generation that occurred from April to July and a fall generation that evolved from August to October. Egg laying began in April and lasted until the end of September. The most favourable exposition for this insect was North. Egg laying average was 8 to 9 eggs per female.

The seasonality of C. elaeidis, its natural enemies and their relationship with temperature, rainfall and relative humidity was observed between January 2009 and December 2010 at the main station of the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research, Nigeria. Past leaf miner population estimates were obtained from NI FOR entomology division from 1976 1980. This study analyses temporal patterns in leaf miner abundance, and elucidates general patterns and factors influencing leaf miner abundance. Multiple linear regressions were used to analyse the relationship between abundance of leaf miner, its parasitoids and predators and the following climatic variables: maximum and minimum temperature ( C), rainfall (mm) and relative humidity (%). For the analyses, climate variables from the month of collection (control variable) or from the month before the collection (delayed variable) were used. The abundance of leaf miner and predatory ants peaked in the dry season, while parasitoids were most abundant in the rainy season. Significant correlations (P <= 0.05) were found between leaf miner, its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. For all years, maximum temperature was the most dominant variable for all the leaf miner stages. Significant correlations were found between leaf miner, its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. This indicates that the weather variables at both the month of collection and with a delayed month in relation to collection is critical for pest-weather evaluation. This is important for leaf miner control. Temperature, rainfall and relative humidity had an effect on the population of C. elaeidis, and this effect is manifested primarily in seasonal fluctuations in oil palm agroecosystems. Weather influenced the seasonal population dynamics of C. elaeidis, facilitating early season build-up on the oil palm host crop.

Two projects were initiated in these regions to gain an understanding of the interaction of black beetle with endophyte/cultivar combinations and pasture renewal strategies. Monitoring of black beetle populations on the project farms showed that overall, abundance steadily declined from 2009 to 2013, possibly due to cool temperatures, and in the case of Bay of Plenty, high rainfall in 2010. In Waikato, pasture renewal in 2012 had no significant effect on beetle abundance in the following year compared to the unrenewed paddocks.

We monitored males using sexual pheromone traps on four cultivars of vine, Pinot noir, Tannat, Gewurztraminer, and Cabernet Sauvignon, in two vine-growing establishments in the Department of Canelones and compiled data on the accumulated effective temperatures for the southern area of Uruguay. We determined that this species undergoes three generations per year and overwinters without diapause as larvae on dried grapes remaining after harvest.

J,"Matosevic, D; Zivkovic, IP",ALIEN PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECT AND MITE SPECIES ON WOODY PLANTS IN CROATIA,"Alien species are defined as species living outside of their natural range and outside of their natural dispersal potential. When an alien species enters a novel environment and has negative ecological and economical impact it becomes invasive species. Alien species are considered as one of the major threats to biodiversity after habitat destruction and enormous damage is done by them to ecosystems and economies. They have been described as an outstanding global problem. Economic damages associated with alien species in several countries in the world amount to about 5 % of the world GNP. Numerous alien insect species, many introduced only in the last 200 years, have become successfully established in various ecosystems in Europe, 1541 species of alien invertebrates are already present, 94 % of them are arthropods and 90 % of them are insects. More than half of the alien invertebrates are phytophagous (52 %) and 30 % of them infest trees and shrubs. Basic knowledge of the identity, origin, pathway, time of introduction of alien species is essential for assessing the threats from alien species and the first requirement when assessing the impact of alien species on ecosystems is to make an alien species inventory of a certain territory or country. Such studies are needed to assess which taxonomic or bio-ecological groups of alien insects are more successful invaders or more harmful to environment and economy. Croatia lacks such an inventory. Even though Croatia was included in most recent and comprehensive study of alien terrestrial arthropodes in Europe, Croatian references with first records were totally missing. There is no up-to-date list of phytophagous alien insect species on woody plants in Croatia. The aim of this paper is to provide up-to-date comprehensive list of known phytophagous alien insect and mite species on woody plants in Croatia with all relevant Croatian references. The starting point for compiling the list of alien species of phytophagous insects on woody plants in Croatia was a book Alien Terrestrial Arthropodes of Europe and database DAISIE. These are primary online resources on alien insect species available to the public and first qualified reference system on invasive alien species for the European region. We compiled the list by searching many sources of forestry, agricultural and taxonomic entomological peer-reviewed literature in Croatia, checklists and primary research publications on alien insect species. The references in these sources were examined for additional relevant publications. A total of 101 phytophagous alien species (98 insect species from 6 orders and 3 mite species form subclass Acarina) on woody plants were recorded (Table 1) and they are already present in Croatian entomofauna. They were dominated by Hemiptera (56.4 %), Lepidoptera (14.9 %), Hymenoptera (12.9 %), followed by Diptera (5.9 %) and Coleoptera (5.9 %), Acarina (3 %) and Thysanoptera (1 %)(Figure 1). One third (33.7 %) of the alien species in Croatia originate from Asia, 26.7 % from North America while 12.9 % are of tropical origin (Figure 2). From the 101 established alien insect species in Croatia, an increase in the number of introductions can be noted in the first decade of 21st century (Figure 3). Agricultural lands are the most frequently invaded habitats by alien phytophagous insects in Croatia (56.4 %), followed by parks and gardens (28.7 %) and woodlands and forests (14.9 %)(Figure 4). Order Hemiptera clearly dominates as it includes some of the most successful invaders (57 %) on woody plants in Croatia. Similar results were obtained at a country level for Hungary, Great Britain, Italy, Slovenia and Europe in general. This outcome can be attributed to the fact that species of this order remain undetected and are easily transported due to their tiny size in concert with the intensive trade in agricultural commodities. The occurrence of other orders (Lepidoptera 14 %, Hymenoptera 13 %, Diptera 6 %, Coleoptera 6 %, and Thysanoptera 1 %) is slightly different from other European countries. Results from several investigations have shown strong positive correlations between the number of alien insects per European country and the volume of manufactured and agricultural imports, road network size, the GDP and the geographic size. In contrast, alien species richness was not correlated with the total or percentage of forest cover. The number of alien insects is positively correlated with country surface area, and bordering the sea does not influence the number of alien insect species which is quite important for Croatia. There is a strong correlation between the number of alien insect species and the total amount of imports and level of international trade of the country. It can be predicted that the number of established alien insect species will grow as Croatia shows constant increase of traded commodities with other European and non-European countries. In this review we have listed alien insect species that have not yet been recorded for Croatia on European level. These are Oxycarenus lavaterae; Massilieurodes chitendeni; Adelges (Dreyfusia) nordmannianae; Pineus (Eopineus) strobi; Protopulvinaria pyriformis; Dryocosmus kuriphilus; Platygaster robinae; Aproceros leucopoda; Rhyzobius lophanthae; Rodolia cardinalis; Harmonia axyridis; Xylosandrus germanus; Caloptilia roscipennella; Caloptilia azaleella; Phyllocnistis citrella; Argyresthia thuiella; Cydalima perspectalis; Dasineura gleditchiae; Ceratitis capitata; Rhagoletis cingulata and Drosophila suzukii. Some of them are novel and only recently introduced alien species whereas some of them are present for decades in Croatia but due to the lack of a comprehensive and regularly updated inventory of alien species they have not been listed before. This also makes this up-to-date list of alien phytophagous insects in Croatia valuable. Our results have shown that Asia is the main region of origin of alien insects established in Croatia (33 %), followed by North America (27 %). The trends are similar in other European countries and Europe in general. A rapid increase in the number of new alien species introduction per year in Croatia is noticeable from the years 2007-2012 (6.4 species/year) compared to 2002-2007 (1.8 species/year) (Figure 3). In Europe, an average of 17.5 new species of insects per year was recorded between 2000 and 2007, while this value was only 8.1 from 1950 to 1974. In Europe twice as many new insect species were observed per year on trees and shrubs during the period 2000-2007 (6.3 species) compared to 1960-1979 (3.4 species). The differences between the number of new alien species/year in Europe and Croatia are probably due to differences in sampling efforts, country surface, volume of traded goods etc but the rapidly increasing trend is obvious. More than 80 % of alien insect species in Croatia (57 % on agricultural lands and 28 % in parks and gardens) have been established in man-made habitats (Figure 4). Only 15 % of alien insect species in Croatia have established themselves in natural environments (forests and woodlands) which is almost the same percentage as on European level. It is a common observation that simple, disturbed, man-made habitats are more easily invaded by insects and other invaders than complex, undisturbed, natural habitats. Alien insects linked to human environments and activities (e.g. ornamental plants, bonsais, seeds, large potted trees, cut flowers, vegetables, fruits) are more likely to be carried by human transports into a new region than insects living in natural areas. A study has shown that bonsais carry a more diverse alien insect fauna then timber and that ornamental plants constitute miniature ecosystems which may host a large variety of insects that have the potential to damage other woody plants as well. Almost 90 % of alien invertebrates in Europe were introduced unintentionally through human activities, mostly as contaminants of a commodity. In Europe, ornamental plant trade contributes significantly more than forestry products to the invasion of alien forest insects. As interception data have not been analysed in this paper, a research of such data for alien insect species and trade volumes in horticultural plants in Croatia is strongly needed. There is a strong suspicion that ornamental plants are one of main pathways of introduction of alien insects to Croatia due to the increase of the imported volumes from year to year. Alien insect species are known for being serious pests worldwide and they can impact habitats which they invade in several ways. Alien insects can affect native biodiversity through direct actions: phytophagous insects feeding on plants, a predator or a parasitoid attacking host, an alien species hybridizing with a native species or indirect actions: vectoring diseases, competing for food, or sharing natural enemies with native species. This research has shown that dangerous pests that can cause direct economic costs have invaded and are spreading in Croatia (Table 1). Due to high percentage of alien insect on agricultural lands (outdoor and in glasshouses) in Croatia (Figure 4) the yield losses of alien insect species on agricultural crops in Croatia must be considerable. Alien insects can have serious negative impact on forests, woodlands and urban parks. Some potentially damaging forest and urban pests have already established themselves in Croatia. In countries where the percentage of forest cover is high (Croatia around 44 %) the damage from alien insects is expected to be considerable. Most introductions of alien insects are unintentional and unpredictable. Less than 20 % of the alien invertebrates in Europe have been intercepted before their arrival. There are several harmful phytophagous alien species approaching the borders of Croatia: Agrilus planipennis which could pose serious threat to Croatian lowland oak ecosystems, Anoplophora sp. which is spreading rapidly in Northern Italy. Some of the most polyphagous alien insect species, such as Drosophila suzukii, have only recently been discovered in Croatia. This study has also shown a time lag between arrival and first record of an alien species which has direct implications on successful eradication measures. Climate change may directly influence establishment and colonisation of alien insect species in new territories-from other continents to Europe and from warmer European regions of Europe further north. Global warming is likely to influence establishment and spread of alien insect species from subtropical and tropical areas (24 % found in Croatia) especially on the Mediterranean coast. One of the main factors, globalisation, will definitely influence the upward trend of introduction and spread of new alien species in Croatia which will negatively influence economy and ecosystems.",no,,,,,SUMARSKI LIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0373-1332,1846-9140,2013,NA,WOS:000320287000007

We used the recently discovered female-produced sex pheromone of the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), to explore this question for populations in the Upper Great Plains. Methods for pheromone trapping were established and trapping data were used to explore geographic distribution, phenology, and density. The pheromone lure remained attractive for up to 10 d and only attracted male Hessian flies. Traps placed within the crop canopy caught flies but traps placed above the crop canopy did not. Hessian flies were trapped throughout North Dakota starting in the spring and continuing through the summer and autumn. Densities were low in the spring but increased greatly during the early part of the summer, with peak adult emergence taking place at a time (July/August) when spring wheat was being harvested and winter wheat had not yet been planted. In the autumn, adults were found at a time when winter wheat seedlings are growing. The discovery of flies on Conservation Reserve Program land supports the idea that pasture grasses serve as alternate hosts. We conclude that the Hessian fly is a risk to wheat in the Upper Great Plains and predict that global warming and the increasing cultivation of winter wheat will add to this risk.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-0493,1938-291X,2012,10.1603/EC12011,WOS:000312445600016

The potential economic impact of cereal crop pests has resulted in substantial research efforts into the understanding of pest agroecosystems and development of pest management strategy. Management strategy is informed frequently by models that describe the population dynamics of important crop pests and because of the economic impact of these pests, many models have been developed. Yet, limited effort has ensued to compare and contrast models for their strategic applicability and quality. One of the most damaging pests of wheat in North America is the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov). Eighteen D. noxia population dynamic models were developed from the literature to describe pest intensity. The strongest models quantified the negative effects of fall and spring precipitation on aphid intensity, and the positive effects associated with alternate food source availability. Population dynamic models were transformed into spatially explicit models and combined to form a spatially explicit, model-averaged result.

We examine here the case of the western conifer seed bug Leptoglossus occidentalis Heidemann (Heteroptera Coreidae), a polyphagous pest of conifer seeds, introduced from northern America into Italy in 1999 and then spreading across the whole Europe. The bug was detected in alpine forests of Trentino (northern Italy) in 2002, and since then known mainly as a nuisance agent for its habit to overwinter inside buildings. The lack of information on the ecology in mountain areas led us to investigate its distribution in some alpine pine stands, in relation to altitude and to fungal pathogens potentially associated. The presence of L. occidentalis was observed in all main geographic areas of Trentino, up to the subalpine belt in the southern part of the region. The seed bug completed one or two generations depending on altitude and local climatic conditions. Field data and rearing under artificial conditions indicated the importance of heat accumulation for the development of nymphal instars and the role of temperature thresholds in regulating adult behaviour. The seed bug was observed on trees (Pinus nigra, P. sylvestris) as well as on shrubs (P. mugo), facilitating the rapid colonisation of a fragmented mountain environment.

Thermal requirements were set as: 7.2 degrees C for lower developmental threshold, 20.6 degrees C for optimum developmental threshold, 25.3 degrees C for maximum temperature and 344.83 degree-days for the thermal constant. The linear model described satisfactorily egg development at intermediate temperatures; nevertheless, a slightly better fit of the observed data was obtained with the Lactin model.

Moreover, the temperature effect on reproductive strategy of females was tested, and the general life history was compared with available data within the wood-feeding guild. The results show that: (i) the growth of A. rubra is slow but compensated by prolonged development; (ii) size dimorphism is probably caused by the longer development time of females; (iii) fecundity is at least partly determined by the temperature experienced during the egg-laying period; and (iv) interspecific comparisons reveal that the life strategy of a wood-feeder depends on the niche occupied within the tree, whilst its breeding strategy (whether capital or income) is controlled at a taxonomic level. Control of all the main life history traits at one time provided a unique opportunity to understand the selection pressures on A. rubra species.

This study focused on the evaluation of the seasonality of natural control factors associated with the guava psyllid Triozoida limbata (Enderlein) in Brazil. Life-table data were collected from an experimental guava orchard during four periods that roughly represented four seasons. Natural mortality was monitored daily through the immature stages, and the relative importance of each natural mortality factor and its seasonality was determined. Significant statistical differences were observed in the mortality during the four periods (P<0.05). Several factors contributed to the mortality of T. limbata, including rainfall, physiological disturbance, the parasitoid Psyllaephagus sp.

Depending on the location of nymphs (exposed or inside galls), the relative importance of the different natural mortality factors changed.

This studies acts by calculating the average of thermal units in degree-days (dd's). The average of thermal units required for completion of generation is 544.98, 640.63 and 599.66 degrees-days (degrees C) as calculated from air temperatures derived from thermograph and satellite images, and soil temperatures from satellite images, respectively, considering 9.89 degrees C as a developmental threshold. These were higher than the estimated value of dd's based on laboratory data (524.27 degrees-days (degrees C)). There was a difference between degree days obtained from air temperatures derived from satellite images and thermograph by 59.2 dd's, this value represented only about 2.85 days. In order to improve the predictability, a factor was estimated between them which is 0.81, 0.96 and 0.87 in case of thermograph, soil and air temperature that derived from satellite images so the predicted stages was highly improved. Egg hatching was estimated to be 80% complete by approximate to 80.45 dd's. At 174.85 DD, mostly all larvae in the field experiment were from the first to third instars. The presence of more mature larvae (fourth to sixth instars) was not noticed until 197.59 dd's. These data indicate that, the best timing for control application against Spodoptera littoralis would be at 174.85-197.59 dd's. The results are important for quick prediction purposes, control timing and also as valuable tools used in an integrated control program for managing S. littoralis in Egypt.

Despite its pest status, there is limited information about the inauence of temperature on development and survival of M. ochroloma. The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of temperature on the development and survival of immature stages, and determine the cold tolerance of immature and adult stages. Development was evaluated at 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, and cold tolerance was measured at 5, 0, and -5 degrees C inside environmentally controlled chambers. Survival of M. ochroloma from egg to adult was approximate to 80% at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C, but only 24% at 30 degrees C. Mean developmental time was longest at 15 degrees C(57 d) and shortest at 30 degrees C (17 d). Leaf area consumed by the fourth instar was 7.4-fold lower at 30 degrees C compared with consumption at 15, 20, or 25 degrees C. The lower developmental threshold varied from 7.3 to 9.8 degrees C and the total degree-days required to complete development from egg to adult was 333. At 5, 0, and -5 degrees C, the LT90 values for the first instar were shorter compared with all other stadia, suggesting that the first instar is the most susceptible to cold temperatures. Eggs were most cold tolerant, followed by pupae and adults.

J,"Inward, DJG; Wainhouse, D; Peace, A",The effect of temperature on the development and life cycle regulation of the pine weevil Hylobius abietis and the potential impacts of climate change,"1 The pine weevil Hylobius abietis is widely distributed in the Palaearctic region where it is a major pest. Although predominantly semi-voltine, with a 2-year life cycle, the generation time across its range can vary from 1 to 4 years. The duration of the life cycle and the seasonal timing of weevil activity affect the economic impact and management of this pest, all of which are likely to change in a warming climate. 2 To determine the effect of temperature and tree species on weevil growth and development, laboratory experiments were performed with eggs, larvae, prepupae, pupae and adults, using, as appropriate, the host species Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. and Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. under constant or alternating temperatures. 3 The development rate was linearly related to temperature, with developmental thresholds for eggs, larvae and pupae of 8, 4.5 and 7.3 degrees C, respectively. Day-degrees were estimated for each life stage. Larval development was affected by tree species, being slower on Sitka spruce than on Scots pine, and was faster under alternating than constant temperatures. 4 The development time for prepupae was highly variable, with an apparent facultative prepupal diapause initiated by temperature. The temperature range 2017.5 degrees C marked the transition between median prepupal development times of approximately 25 and 90 days. The prepupal stage may serve to minimize the risk of overwintering mortality in the pupal stage and help to synchronize the life cycle. 5 Larval and adult mass was positively related to developmental temperature, demonstrating an inverse temperature size rule, and weevils were heavier when developing on Scots pine than Sitka spruce. Development in alternating temperatures reduced weevil mass on Scots pine. The influence of temperature on weevil mass is likely to have a positive effect on fecundity and overwintering survival. The effects of climate change on development, voltinism and weevil mass are discussed.",no,,,,,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1461-9555,NA,2012,10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00575.x,WOS:000309917900003

Both larvae and adults feed on the phloem vessels of the leaves, causing characteristic symptoms also referred to as hopperburn. Phenology of adult leafhoppers was monitored in one vineyard in three successive years and indicated that immigration of a few hibernated E. vitis individuals into vineyards might take place already quite early in the year depending on winter temperatures and starts to progress in substantial numbers right at grapevine bud burst. In addition, these monitoring studies have shown that there are several other leafhopper species occurring on grapevine plants besides E. vitis, such as the rose leafhopper Edwardsiana rosae (Homoptera: Cicadellidae). Here, we report on the development of larval instars of both leafhopper species, E. vitis and E. rosae on grapevine leaves under different temperature regimes in the laboratory. Shortest larval developmental time was observed at night temperatures of 1315 degrees C and day temperatures of 2325 degrees C, which was in agreement with predicted optimal temperatures for both species. At the temperature regime of 20 degrees C night and 30 degrees C day temperature, either no egg hatch was observed or early development of first-instar larvae was not successful for both species. These results suggest that warm (18 degrees C) nights and moderately warm (28 degrees C) days are representing the upper thermal threshold for development of both E. vitis and E. rosae embryonic stages on grapevine leaves, questioning current assumptions of an increasing importance of E. vitis as a grapevine pest under future climate change.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0931-2048,NA,2012,10.1111/j.1439-0418.2011.01699.x,WOS:000310552700003

We analyzed a 16-year time-series from the European Alps of timber loss in Picea abies Karsten forests due to I. typographus attacks and used a discrete population model and an information theoretic approach to compare multiple competing hypotheses. The occurrence of dry summers combined with warm temperatures appeared as the main abiotic triggers of severity of outbreaks. We also found an endogenous negative feedback with a 2-year lag suggesting a potential important role of natural enemies. Forest damage per hectare averaged 7-fold higher where spruce was planted in sites warmer than those within its historical climatic range. Dry summers, but not temperature, was related to upward shifts in the altitudinal outbreak range. Considering the potential increased susceptibility of spruce forests to insect outbreaks due to climate change, there is growing value in mitigating these effects through sustainable forest management, which includes avoiding the promotion of spruce outside its historical climatic range.",yes,field,damage,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0165-0009,1573-1480,2012,10.1007/s10584-012-0463-z,WOS:000309867100004

J,"Maiorano, A; Bregaglio, S; Donatelli, M; Fumagalli, D; Zucchini, A",Comparison of modelling approaches to simulate the phenology of the European corn borer under future climate scenarios,"The phenological development of insects is simulated predominantly via models based on the response of the organisms to air temperature. Despite of a large body of literature supporting the evidence that the organism physiological response to temperature is nonlinear, including a declining phase, most of these models calculate the rate of development using a linear approach, implying that air temperatures mostly does not fall outside of the linear region of response to temperature of the organism. Another simplification is represented by the calculation of the rate of development using daily mean air temperature, which has already been demonstrated being a reliable method only in limited conditions. It can be hypothesized that the use of developmental models based on linear developmental rates, which can be successfully applied under climate conditions to which organisms are well adapted, could be inadequate under either future climatic scenarios or when extreme events occur (e.g., heat waves). In such contexts, linear responses might lead to interpretations of climate effects not consistent with the real organism physiological response to temperature. In this work the case of Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner (European corn borer, ECB) development was taken as an example to compare (i) a nonlinear approach with hourly air temperature as input (HNL approach), (ii) a linear based approach with hourly air temperature as input (HL approach), (iii) a linear based approach with daily air temperature as input (averaging method, DL approach), and (iv) a linear based approach using a cutoff temperature with daily air temperature as input (DLcutoff approach). The comparison was performed under the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change) emission scenario A1B, and three time frames in Europe: 1995-2004 (baseline-2000s), 2015-2024 (2020s), and 2045-2054 (2050s). The SRES A1B was selected as one of those for which the projected raise of temperature is estimated to be one of the highest, although the projected difference comparing to the other SRES is estimated as evident in the 2050s time frame, among the ones considered. Using degree-days as a proxy for the rate of development, results showed that the DL approach predicts more than the HNL in all the time frames in almost all Europe with the exception of Southern Italy and the Mediterranean coasts of France and Spain where the differences were negligible. These effects were due (i) to the linear relationship used by the DL approach, and partially (ii) to the averaging operation that decrease the effects of high temperatures in regions with high (but not extreme) warm temperatures. The HNL and HL approach predicted the same pattern of degree-days accumulation in all Europe with the exception of the regions of Southern Iberian peninsula (across all the timeframes), Balkans, and Turkey (under the 2050 scenario). This effect was due to the different HNL and HL accumulation of degree-days at temperatures higher than the ECB optimum temperature. The comparison between the DLcutoff and the HNL approaches showed similar results to the DL vs HNL approach in central and Northern Europe, while in Southern Europe a negative difference (more DD accumulated for the HNL approach) were observed: in regions characterized by high temperatures, the cutoff temperature, setting a limit to the maximum temperatures diminished the calculated average temperature and as a consequence the calculated degree-days. The results of this work showed that according to the method chosen for simulations, different results can be obtained, hence leading to different conclusions about the effect of a warming climate on pest development. These results stress the need of reconsidering the appropriateness of models to be used, which cannot be assumed as correct on the basis of their effectiveness under current conditions.

However, in the high mountain zone there are still large areas of species-rich grasslands. The aim of this study was to assess the oviposition preferences of the shrub-feeding Blue-spot hairstreak Satyrium spini (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775), in montane common pastures in the Spanish Pyrenees and recommend a way of managing these grasslands that favours this species. Our study showed that females of S. spini laid their eggs on Dwarf buckthorn (Rhamnus pumila Turra) and Alpine buckthorn (R. alpina L.), which are novel host plant records for Spain. A warm microclimate was of crucial importance for egg-laying. Occupied plants grew mostly at sparsely vegetated grassland sites where there were large patches of bare rocks, stones or gravel. Most egg batches were laid close to the ground and 75% consisted of only one egg. The number of batches per R. pumila plant was higher on east-, south-and west-facing slopes than on north-facing slopes. Presence of eggs and the number of egg batches per R. pumila plant were best explained by a long sunshine duration. At high altitudes particularly warm microhabitats seem to be more important for S. spini than at lower altitudes in Central Europe. We assume that the preference for unusually warm microhabitats is explained by the cold climatic conditions near the altitudinal range limit of the species. That most of the eggs were laid singly and not in small batches as in Central Europe might be a risk-spreading strategy to cope with the harsh climatic conditions and the high inter-annual variation in weather conditions in the high mountain zone in the Pyrenees.

In Lubbock, high tunnel lettuce was harvested an average 16 days earlier in 2010 compared with open-field lettuce (P > 0.0001), while in 2011, high temperatures and bolting required that open-field lettuce be harvested 4 days earlier than lettuce grown in high tunnels. On average, lettuce cultivars at Mount Vernon matured and were harvested 56 to 61 DAT in 2010 and 54 to 64 DAT in 2011 with no significant differences between high tunnel and open-field production systems. Total and marketable yields at Mount Vernon and Lubbock averaged across cultivars were comparable in both high tunnel and open-field plots. At Knoxville, although total yields were significantly higher (P > 0.0062) in high tunnels than open-field plots, incidence of insect, disease, and physiological damage in high tunnel plots reduced lettuce quality and marketable yield (P > 0.0002). Lettuce head length:diameter ratio (LDR) averaged across cultivars was equal between high tunnel and the open field at all three locations. High tunnel production systems offer greater control of environments suitable for lettuce production, especially in climates like Knoxville and Lubbock where later-planted open-field systems may be more susceptible to temperature swings that may affect lettuce quality. These results suggest that although high tunnel culture alone may influence lettuce yield and quality, regional climates likely play a critical role in determining the impact of these two production systems on marketable lettuce yields.",no,,,,,HORTTECHNOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1063-0198,NA,2012,10.21273/HORTTECH.22.5.659,WOS:000310097600015

Developmental time in days for immature stages and total development (egg to adult) on both host species were inversely proportional to temperature between 8 and 27 degrees C but increased at 31 degrees C. One linear and two nonlinear models were fitted to the data. The lower developmental thresholds, calculated using the linear model for egg, total nymph, and total development (from oviposition to adult emergence) were 7.9, 4.2, and 7.1 degrees C (reared on potato) and 7.2, 5.3, and 7.5 degrees C (reared on tomato), respectively. The thermal constant (K) for total development was 358 (reared on potato), and 368 (reared on tomato) degree-days (DD). Two nonlinear models, Briere and Lactin, fit the data well as measured by goodness-of-fit criteria, the residual sum of square (RSS) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). Temperature threshold parameters for these nonlinear models (T-0, T-opt, and T-max) were estimated for eggs, total nymphal stages, and total development time (egg to adult).

To investigate how the abundance of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is related to environmental factors and the length of the fallow period in Martinique, we developed an extensive data set (18,130 observations of weevil abundance obtained with pheromone traps plus associated environmental data) and analysed it with generalized mixed-effects models. At the island scale, C. sordidus abundance was positively related to mean temperature and negatively related to mean rainfall but was not related to soil type. The number of insects trapped was highest during the driest months of the year. Abundance of C. sordidus decreased as the duration of the preceding fallow period increased. The latter finding is inconsistent with the view that fallow-generated decomposing banana tissue is an important resource for larvae that leads to an increase in the pest population.

(Solanaceae), in tropical and subtropical regions in both field and storeroom situations. The modeling of temperature-dependent development can be useful in forecasting occurrence and population dynamics of the pests. Published developmental parameters for this pest vary greatly for many reasons. We determined temperature-dependent development of P. operculella at seven constant temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 34 and 36 degrees C). Developmental period of whole immature stage (egg to the end of the pupal stage) varied from 75.5 days at 16 degrees C to 17 days at 32 degrees C. The population failed to survive at 36 degrees C. The observed data was modeled to determine mathematical functions for simulating P. operculella development in each stage of development and overall. Two linear models, ordinary linear regression and the Ikemoto linear model were used to describe the relationship between temperature and development rate of the different stages of P. operculella and estimating the thermal constant and lower temperature threshold. The lower temperature threshold (t) and thermal constant (k) of whole immature stage were estimated to be 11.6 degrees C and 338.5 DD by Ikemoto linear model, and the estimated parameters were not substantially different with those estimated by ordinary linear models. Different models provided a better fit to the various developmental stages. Of the eleven nonlinear models fitted, the Beriere-1, Logan-6 and Lactin-1 model was found to be the best for modeling development rate of egg, larva and pupa of P. operculella, respectively.

Cold hardening is presumed to start during diapause development to ensure the successful overwintering of this species. To address this hypothesis, we compared cold tolerance between non-diapausing and diapausing females. We measured supercooling point (SCP) and survival to acute cold stress by exposing the mites at a range of sub-zero temperatures (from -4 to -28 degrees C for 2 h). The mean SCPs of non-diapausing and diapausing females were -19.6 +/- 0.5 and -24.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C respectively, and freezing killed the mites. Diapausing females were significantly more cold tolerant than non-diapausing ones, with LT50 of -19.7 and -13.3 degrees C. respectively. Further, we also examined the effects of cold acclimation (10 d at 0 or 5 degrees C) in non-diapausing and diapausing females. Our findings indicated that diapause decreased SCP significantly, while cold acclimation had no effect on the SCP except for non-diapausing females that were acclimated at 5 degrees C. Acclimation at 5 degrees C enhanced survival to acute cold stress in diapausing and non-diapausing females, with LT50 of -22.0 and -17.1 degrees C, respectively. Altogether, our results indicate that T. urticae is a chill tolerant species, and that diapause and cold acclimation elevate cold hardiness in this species. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Modelling efforts offer the ability to consider a much wider range of realistic climate projections and are therefore useful, in particular, for estimating the sensitivity of impact predictions to differences in geographical location, and choice of climate change scenario and climate model projections. In this study, we used well-established degree-day models to predict the voltinism of 13 agronomically important pests in California, USA. We ran these models using the projections from three AtmosphereOcean Coupled Global Circulation Models (AOCGCMs or GCMs), in conjunction with the SRES scenarios. We ran these for two locations representing northern and southern California. We did this for both the 2050s and 2090s. We used anova to partition the variation in the resulting voltinism among time period, climate change scenario, GCM and geographical location. For these 13 pest species, the choice of climate model explained an average of 42% of the total variation in voltinism, far more than did geographical location (33%), time period (17%) or scenario (1%). The remaining 7% of the variation was explained by various interactions, of which the location by GCM interaction was the strongest (5%). Regardless of these sources of uncertainty, a robust conclusion from our work is that all 13 pest species are likely to experience increases in the number of generations that they complete each year. Such increased voltinism is likely to have significant consequences for crop protection and production.",no,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,1365-2486,2012,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02748.x,WOS:000307222700009

Data for nine insect pests and three meteorological factors were collected on the Korean nationwide scale from 1992 to 2008. The SOM analysis was based on annual mean densities of each pest species in eight regions. We classified the samples into five clusters (I-V) to display the spatial and temporal changes in the insect pests' occurrences. Clusters I and II included samples collected before 2000; clusters III and IV included samples collected after 2000. The density of Scotinophara lurida was in the lowest range in clusters I and II, and Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus exhibited higher densities in clusters Ill and IV. Seasonal temperature, humidity, and precipitation were significantly different among clusters, indicating that these factors play a key role in population dynamics and the occurrence of insect pests. The occurrence area of the insect pests was expected to increase with elevated air temperature influenced by global warming based on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) A1B scenario. This study suggests that gathering data on temporal and spatial variations in pest populations and changes in occurrence rate under the effects of global warming can provide insight into the factors governing the population-environment relationships, as well as the information needed for future pest management.

In both years, the degree-day model predicted the average egg peak within 3 d of the observed calendar date. There was also a consistent period between egg and larval peaks averaging 17.5 d. Given the accuracy of this model, historical high and low temperature data were used to create a predictive map of the calendar week that different areas of Virginia and North Carolina would exceed 182 DD, and was validated using survey data from 60 field sites in 2010 and 65 sites in 2011 throughout Virginia and North Carolina. Finally, correlation and linear regression analyses were performed using data from all cereal leaf beetle study populations in 2010 and 2011, as well as previously collected data to determine if the number of eggs at peak could be used to predict larval peak numbers.

We evaluated the effect of constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32.5 degrees C on the reproduction of P. xylostella and developed an oviposition model for the species. The model combined temperature-dependent parameters of total fecundity, age-specific oviposition rate and age-specific survival. Additionally, we modelled population growth as a function of temperature. The estimated parameters allowed us to discuss the possible consequences of global warming on P. xylostella distribution. Temperature affected the length of pre-oviposition after adult emergence, oviposition period, longevity, total fecundity and egg viability. The model predicted that both daily egg production and length of oviposition period decreased at temperatures below 15 degrees C and above 25 degrees C. Population growth increased linearly with temperature in a range from 10 degrees C to 25 degrees C; however, the model predicted a reduction in population growth at temperatures above 28.6 degrees C.

Overwintering adults of the elm leaf beetle showed a complex sugar/polyol cryoprotectant system. The major components of the multiple systems were glucose, myo-inositol and trehalose. In this study, we investigated the seasonal profile of low molecular weight compounds and glycogen in natural population and also in response to thermal constant regimes (5 and 15 degrees C). Among these components, a remarkable seasonal pattern of accumulation/depletion was observed in myo-inositol over the course of hibernation with the development of diapause progress. Incubating at 5 degrees C only elicited a strong response in myo-inositol synthesis during diapause. It suggests that the elm leaf beetle accumulates myo-inositol not only in relation to entering diapause but also in response to low temperatures and their interactions. The laboratory acclimation experiments showed that adults exposed to 15 degrees C had no chance for accumulation of low molecular weight carbohydrate even during diapause. The results of this study illustrated that overwintering adults of elm leaf beetle produce myo-inositol as the primary substance which plays a specific role in some biochemical adjustments in overwintering adults of X. luteola.

J,"de Sassi, C; Tylianakis, JM",Climate Change Disproportionately Increases Herbivore over Plant or Parasitoid Biomass,"All living organisms are linked through trophic relationships with resources and consumers, the balance of which determines overall ecosystem stability and functioning. Ecological research has identified a multitude of mechanisms that contribute to this balance, but ecologists are now challenged with predicting responses to global environmental changes. Despite a wealth of studies highlighting likely outcomes for specific mechanisms and subsets of a system (e.g., plants, plant-herbivore or predator-prey interactions), studies comparing overall effects of changes at multiple trophic levels are rare. We used a combination of experiments in a grassland system to test how biomass at the plant, herbivore and natural enemy (parasitoid) levels responds to the interactive effects of two key global change drivers: warming and nitrogen deposition. We found that higher temperatures and elevated nitrogen generated a multitrophic community that was increasingly dominated by herbivores. Moreover, we found synergistic effects of the drivers on biomass, which differed across trophic levels. Both absolute and relative biomass of herbivores increased disproportionately to that of plants and, in particular, parasitoids, which did not show any significant response to the treatments.

J,"Maiorano, A",A physiologically based approach for degree-day calculation in pest phenology models: the case of the European Corn Borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn.) in Northern Italy,"Phenological models based on degree-day accumulation have been developed to support the integrated pest management of many insects. Most of these models are based on linear relationships between temperature and development, and on daily time step simulations using daily minimum and maximum temperatures. This approach represents an approximation that does not take into account the insect physiological response to temperature, and daily temperature fluctuations. The objective of this work has been to develop a phenological model for the European corn borer (ECB) based on the insect physiological response to temperature and running at an hourly time step. Two modeling solutions based on the same generic compartmental system have been compared: the first based on a physiologically based relationship between temperature and development, and using hourly derived temperatures as input (HNL modeling solution); and the second based on a linear relationship between temperature and degree-day accumulation and using daily temperature (DL modeling solution). The two approaches have been compared using ECB moth capture data from the Piemonte region in Northern Italy. The HNL modeling solution showed the best results for all the accuracy indicators. The DL modeling solution showed a tendency to anticipate ECB phenological development too early. This tendency is attributable to the linear relationship between temperature and development, which does not take into account (1) the decline of this relationship at high temperatures, and (2) the daily fluctuation of temperature. As a consequence, degree-days accumulation is accelerated in the DL modeling solution and the phenological development anticipated.",no,,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0020-7128,1432-1254,2012,10.1007/s00484-011-0464-z,WOS:000305685900009

In temperate Japan, the occurrence of this leafhopper fluctuates widely among years. Here, we examined effects of climatic factors (temperature, precipitation and sunlight) on the occurrence of C. bipunctata. Seasonal occurrence of adult C. bipunctata in a census field from July to August, when forage maize was most susceptible to the pest, could be described by a simple exponential function with two parameter: estimated density of C. bipunctata on 1 July (N (0)) and intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) for each year. Forward stepwise multiple regression analysis using seasonal occurrence data from 2004 to 2009 detected positive contributions of average temperatures in the previous December and February and a negative contribution of total precipitation during the previous winter to N (0). The analysis also indicated that average temperature in July of the current year and N (0) contributed positively and negatively to r, respectively. These results indicated that high temperature and little precipitation during winter and high temperature in early summer induced high occurrence of C. bipunctata in summer. A prediction model based on these factors supported the actual seasonal occurrence in 2010, suggesting that this prediction model is applicable to C. bipunctata forecasting. The prediction model indicated that further global warming in the future is likely to cause further outbreaks of C. bipunctata.",yes,field,rm,,,POPULATION ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1438-3896,1438-390X,2012,10.1007/s10144-012-0320-y,WOS:000305688400004

When combined with previous work on degree-day based mortality, we were able to evaluate how the magnitude of population reduction and survival varied between sites, years, and generations at locations in California, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington states. In general, reductions in population growth associated with females mating 1-3 days after emergence were greater in warmer areas and during warmer times of the year. In any given year and location, the temperature profiles during peak flight were crucial in determining the population reductions, but over an 11-year period, the average seasonal temperature profile was more important. During the overwintering generation, conditions were relatively mild in all locations and only minor differences were observed in population growth rates between locations. Populations experiencing 1-3 days delay in female mating were reduced 8, 19 and 32 % compared to populations experiencing no delay, respectively. During the first summer generation, population reductions doubled compared to those seen in the overwintering generation. During the second summer flight, reductions in population growth rate at the three cooler locations decreased, while they increased in the warmer California location.

Our aim was to determine the mechanisms driving long-term population dynamics as a prerequisite for ecologically based areawide pest management. The population density of three pestiferous Anastrepha species [Anastrepha ludens (Loew), Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart), and Anastrepha serpentina (Wiedemann)] was determined in grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi Macfad.), mango (Mangifera indica L.), and sapodilla [Manilkara zapota (L.) P. Royen] orchards in central Veracruz, Mexico, on a weekly basis over an 11-yr period. Fly populations exhibited relatively stable dynamics over time. Population dynamics were mainly driven by a direct density-dependent effect and a seasonal feedback process. We discovered direct and delayed influences that were correlated with both local (rainfall and air temperature) and global climatic variation (El Nino Southern Oscillation [ENSO] and North Atlantic Oscillation [NAO]), and detected differences among species and location of orchards with respect to the magnitude and nature (linear or nonlinear) of the observed effects, suggesting that highly mobile pest outbreaks become uncertain in response to significant climatic events at both global and local levels. That both NAO and ENSO affected Anastrepha population dynamics, coupled with the high mobility of Anastrepha adults and the discovery that when measured as rate of population change, local population fluctuations exhibited stable dynamics over time, suggests potential management scenarios for the species studied lie beyond the local scale and should be approached from an areawide perspective.

Resistance to Cry toxins has been reported in laboratory-and field-selected populations of various Lepidoptera species and several studies have identified fitness costs associated with Cry toxin resistance. Here, fitness costs are examined in the first insect population to be reported with resistance to a Vip toxin, a laboratory-selected Vip3A-resistant subpopulation of the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (L.)

Vip3A resistance was also associated with reduced egg viability and mating success and a lower intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) at temperatures below (20 degrees C) and above (30 degrees C) the optimal laboratory culture temperature. The latter findings agree with previous studies, that fitness costs associated with resistance are usually greater under stressful conditions.

The establishment of new outbreak pest species may have major effects on northern ecosystems that are particularly sensitive to disturbances. 2. Effects of winter minimum temperatures under field and laboratory conditions were examined and limitations by minimum temperatures on future range expansion were investigated for invasive [Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae)] and potentially invasive [Agriopis aurantiaria (Lepidoptera: Geometridae)] birch-feeding forest pests. The results for the studied invasive and potentially invasive moths were compared with the parameters of the resident moth species Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae). 3. The results showed tolerated critical temperatures of the invader (O. brumata) and the resident (E. autumnata) were more similar (differing only by 1 degrees C), whereas the potential invader (A. aurantiaria) was much less tolerant of cold temperatures. Although describing different stages of overwintering, results were consistent between laboratory and field studies except for those at one field location, at which other abiotic conditions are suggested to have significant influence on moth egg survival. 4.

Mating peaked between 14:00 h and 15:00 h and 87% of the females were fertilized and started laying eggs 1.25 (+/- 1.14) days after mating. Females were generally monandrous, but nevertheless remained attractive after mating. The results of this study provide the necessary background knowledge for studying several aspects of P. archon reproductive biology, in particular oviposition, sex pheromones and their role in mediating mating behaviour in this pest. These results are the first step in developing tools for monitoring populations of this pest.",no,,,,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,1802-8829,2012,10.14411/eje.2012.037,WOS:000302587400019

The meteorological factors, temperature, air relative humidity, rainfall, and sunshine hours, were used to provide precision indexes to evaluate the best predictor for the date of the first capture of alate aphids by the traps. The degree-day model indicated that the peak population of the evaluated aphid species can be predicted using one of the following biofix dates: January 1st, June 1st, and the date of the first capture of the alate aphid species by the yellow water traps.

The thrips (Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood) and the greenfly (Empoasca flavescens Fabricius), which were previously considered as minor or occasionally as serious pests in localized areas of tea plantations, are now established as regular and at times major pests in tea plantations of North Bengal spread over the sub Himalayan slopes and the adjoining plains of Terai and the Dooars. Tea-planters from different pockets of North Bengal have been repeatedly reporting control failures of these pests with the use of insecticides in recommended dilutions. A study of their seasonal incidence along with activity of detoxifying enzymes was considered. The trend of a recent population study revealed that E. flavescens and S. dorsalis were abundant throughout the year, with peaks during April to June. Abiotic factors such as temperature, rainfall, sunshine hours and relative humidity (afternoon) influenced the population abundance. Insecticide-exposed populations showed higher levels of activity of the detoxifying enzymes than those collected from organic plantations and the laboratory-reared populations that had not been exposed to insecticides. Detoxifying enzymes in insecticide-exposed E. flavescens collected from Terai and the Dooars as compared with laboratory control specimens showed 3.0-5.2 and 3.0-9.7-fold increases in general esterases (GEs), 1.5-4.8 and 3.6-5.3-fold increases in cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and 1.2-3.5 and 1.5-2.5-fold increases in glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs), respectively.

J,"Ma, G; Ma, CS",Effect of acclimation on heat-escape temperatures of two aphid species: Implications for estimating behavioral response of insects to climate warming,"An aphid usually stays at one feeding site for a long time to achieve its development and reproduction, while high temperatures can make it decide to escape from heat stress. Climate warming increases daily high-temperature both in degree and time. However, it remains unknown whether such heat-escape behavior will be influenced by those daily temperature changes. In this study, a wheat-leaf temperature gradient was created based on field microhabitat temperatures. We defined a parameter, heat-escape temperature (HET) to describe the critical temperature at which an aphid turns back when it walks along the gradient from mild temperature to high temperatures. HET indicates behavioral responses of the aphids to heat stress. Two aphid species, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi, main economic pests in temperate areas were selected as test insects. Detailed studies were conducted on the temperature gradient to reveal effects of acclimation temperature, time, and condition (temperature x time) on HET of both species. Results showed that HET decreased non-linearly (S. avenae: 41.4-38.6 degrees C, R. padi: 41.3-39.4 degrees C), when acclimation temperature increased from 25 to 36 degrees C. For both species, HET declined linearly (S. avenae: 40.1-38.0 degrees C, R. padi: 41.3-38.5 degrees C) as acclimation time increased from 0.5 to 6 h at 35 degrees C, whereas HET descended non-linearly with reduction of acclimation time at 10 degrees C. HET for both species acclimated under constantly warm conditions (future daily temperature) were significantly lower than those acclimated under gradually warm conditions (current daily temperature). These results suggest that aphids' heat-escape behavior is significantly influenced by brief thermal history, implying that aphids make decision to avoid heat stress based on the combination of temperature and exposure time and escape before they were hurt by high temperatures under the conditions of climate warming. Avoiding high temperatures may cost a lot of time and resources of aphids and thus potentially reduced growth, development, and reproduction. Changes in insect behaviors caused by ongoing climate warming and their ecological consequences should be more concerned. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the links between population dynamic theory and model construction have been less emphasized in the management and control of weed populations. Most management models of weed population dynamics have emphasized the role of the endogenous process, but the role of exogenous variables such as climate have been ignored in the study of weed populations and their management. Here, we use long-term data (22 years) on two annual weed species from a locality in Central Spain to determine the importance of endogenous and exogenous processes (local and large-scale climate factors). Our modeling study determined two different feedback structures and climate effects in the two weed species analyzed. While Descurainia sophia exhibited a second-order feedback and low climate influence, Veronica hederifolia was characterized by a first-order feedback structure and important effects from temperature and rainfall. Our results strongly suggest the importance of theoretical population dynamics in understanding plant population systems. Moreover, the use of this approach, discerning between the effect of exogenous and endogenous factors, can be fundamental to applying weed management practices in agricultural systems and to controlling invasive weedy species. This is a radical change from most approaches currently used to guide weed and invasive weedy species managements.",no,,,,,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1932-6203,NA,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0030569,WOS:000301454400140
J,"Cardenas, AM; Gallardo, P","The effect of temperature on the preimaginal development of the Jewel beetle, Coraebus florentinus (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)","Environmental degradation caused by climate change greatly affects the forest ecosystems of the Mediterranean region, in particular the sclerophyllous Quercus forests typical of central and southern Spain. An important pest that damages oak trees in this area is Coraebus florentinus (Herbst), a heliophilous and thermophilous insect whose survival could be favoured by the temperature increase associated with climate change. The main objective of this paper was to determine the effect of temperature on the duration and percentage survival of the preimaginal stage of C. florentinus and provide data for determining more precisely when to control for this pest by applying silvicultural techniques. The experiment included six treatments, with 25 branches infested with C. florentinus in each of the treatments, which were kept at different temperatures over the range 15-28 degrees C. The results clearly support the hypothesis that higher temperatures affect the post-larval development of C. florentinus by increasing the percentage survival and shortening the developmental time. In fact, partial correlations confirm that the highest percentages of emergence and survival were recorded when the developmental times were shortest, which occurred at the highest temperatures used. Despite the clear influence of temperature on the development of the preimaginal stage of C. florentinus, additional trials are required to accurately determine future trends in C. florentinus populations. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop monitoring programs in zones affected by C. florentinus and to apply scheduled management techniques that ensure the control of this species.",no,,,,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,1802-8829,2012,10.14411/eje.2012.004,WOS:000299800200004

The main objective of this study was to explore the effects of density (delayed) dependence and minimum annual temperature (MAT), which indirectly reflects climate warming, on the population dynamics of this pest. We found that both density dependence and MAT have significant influence on the annual population growth rate. The GAMs had relatively better applicability to the dataset than the linear models. Nonparametric model provided satisfactory goodness-of-fit (R-2 > 0.5). At Xinfeng County, the MAT had a significant effect on the annual population growth rate of S. incertulas. The annual population growth rate of S. incertulas decreased with increase in MAT. Therefore, S. incertulas population becomes smaller and smaller in Southern China due to climate warming.

In this study, we examined mite population dynamics and leaf damage over a 1-year period in a commercial plantation of C. citriodora subsp. variegata. Our aims were to link the incidence and severity of mite damage, and mite numbers, to leaf physical traits (moisture content and specific leaf weight (SLW)); to identify any seasonal changes in leaf surface occupancy (upper vs. lower lamina); and host tree canopy strata (upper, mid or lower canopy). We compared population trends with site rainfall, temperature and humidity. We also examined physical and anatomical changes in leaf tissue in response to mite infestation to characterize the plants' physiological reaction to feeding, and how this might affect photosynthesis. Our main findings included positive correlations with leaf moisture content and mite numbers and with mite numbers and damage severity. Wet and dry leaf mass and SLW were greater for damaged tissue than undamaged tissue. Mites were distributed equally throughout the canopy and on both leaf surfaces. No relationships with climatic factors were found. Damage symptoms occurred equally and were exactly mirrored on both leaf surfaces. Mite infestation increased the overall epidermal thickness and the number and size of epidermal cells and was also associated with a rapid loss of chloroplasts from mesophyll cells beneath damage sites. The integrity of the stomatal complex was severely compromised in damaged tissues.

Physiological changes in relation to ambient temperature were also investigated in field-collected overwintering larvae. The glycogen content decreased as ambient temperature decreased; this decline was proportional to increases in trehalose content. In January, which has a mean ambient temperature of 8.0 degrees C, the glycogen content of the larvae was at its lowest level (17.98 mg/g fresh body weight) whereas trehalose was at its highest level (23.99 mg/g fresh body weight). Total body lipids decreased during overwintering and reached the lowest level at the onset of spring.

Given their economic and ecological relevance, detailed forecasting tools for various pests and diseases have been developed, which model their phenology, depending on actual weather conditions, and suggest management decisions on that basis. Assessing the future risk of pest-related damages requires future weather data at high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we use a combined stochastic weather generator and re-sampling procedure for producing site-specific hourly weather series representing present and future (1980-2009 and 2045-2074 time periods) climate conditions in Switzerland. The climate change scenarios originate from the ENSEMBLES multi-model projections and provide probabilistic information on future regional changes in temperature and precipitation. Hourly weather series are produced by first generating daily weather data for these climate scenarios and then using a nearest neighbor re-sampling approach for creating realistic diurnal cycles. These hourly weather series are then used for modeling the impact of climate change on important life phases of the codling moth and on the number of predicted infection days of fire blight. Codling moth (Cydia pomonella) and fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) are two major pest and disease threats to apple, one of the most important commercial and rural crops across Europe. Results for the codling moth indicate a shift in the occurrence and duration of life phases relevant for pest control. In southern Switzerland, a 3rd generation per season occurs only very rarely under today's climate conditions but is projected to become normal in the 2045-2074 time period. While the potential risk for a 3rd generation is also significantly increasing in northern Switzerland (for most stations from roughly 1% on average today to over 60% in the future for the median climate change signal of the multi-model projections), the actual risk will critically depend on the pace of the adaptation of the codling moth with respect to the critical photoperiod. To control this additional generation, an intensification and prolongation of control measures (e.g. insecticides) will be required, implying an increasing risk of pesticide resistances. For fire blight, the projected changes in infection days are less certain due to uncertainties in the leaf wetness approximation and the simulation of the blooming period. Two compensating effects are projected, warmer temperatures favoring infections are balanced by a temperature-induced advancement of the blooming period, leading to no significant change in the number of infection days under future climate conditions for most stations.",no,,,,,EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2190-4979,2190-4987,2012,10.5194/esd-3-33-2012,WOS:000328758100003

As an alternative, we compared the capture of female and male grape berry moth in panel traps baited with synthetic host volatiles with captures of males in pheromone-baited wing traps over two growing seasons in two blocks of grapes in a commercial vineyard in central New York. Lures formulated in hexane to release either 7-component or 13-component host volatile blends captured significantly more male and female grape berry moth on panel traps compared with the numbers captured on panel traps with hexane-only lures. For both sexes over both years, the same or more moths were captured in panel traps along the forest edge compared with the vineyard edge early in the season but this pattern was reversed by mid-season. Male moths captured in pheromone-baited wing traps also displayed this temporal shift in location. There was a significant positive correlation between captured males and females on panel traps although not between females captured on panel traps and males captured in pheromone-baited traps for both years suggesting pheromone traps do not accurately reflect either female or male activity. Male moths captured in pheromone traps indicated a large peak early in each season corresponding to first flight followed by lower and variable numbers that did not clearly indicate second and third flights.

The impact of aphids as pests is well characterized by their population growth rate, a parameter integrating their age-specific development, survivorship, and fecundity. These population parameters were measured at five constants temperatures on potted prune trees. Development rates increased with temperature up to an optimum. The relationship between development rate and temperature was described by linear and nonlinear models. Developmental threshold temperature was greater for the nonlinear model than for the linear model. Thermal requirement for development and maximum lethal temperature determined by these models were similar to those for other aphids. The greatest proportional survivorship of nymphs occurred at 26 degrees C. Mean daily fecundity was lowest at 14 degrees C and highest at 22 degrees C. Adult longevity decreased with temperature. Population growth rates for H. pruni were estimated from measurements of fecundity and development time and were highest at 22 degrees C. This is the first study to document the temperature dependence of the life history parameters for H. pruni and the first to generate a degree-day model for the prediction of phenological events.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-0493,1938-291X,2011,10.1603/EC11145,WOS:000298281700013

To assist in the rapid development of phenology models, we merged a previously published database of thermal requirements for insects, gathered by online search in CAB Abstracts, with independently collected data for insects and mites from original studies. The merged database comprises developmental times at various constant temperatures on 1,054 insect and mite species, many of them in several populations, mostly pests and their natural enemies, from all over the world.

The efficiency of most control methods depends on the treatment of pest populations at their most susceptible stages, therefore the prediction of the moth's development cycle would help greatly in determining an optimal treatment schedule. One strategy for protecting against this pest is based on the day of maximum flight of males per generation (peak flight), when the mating between males and females and the laying of eggs reaches its maximum. The knowledge of these times would enable us to decide the kind of insecticide and the best time to target it. The time of maximum flight can be predicted by the Touzeau model of accumulated average daily temperature exceeding the development threshold. As shown, the fit of this model on data from the Ribera del Duero region in Spain is not accurate enough. Therefore, we propose an empirical and biologically plausible model based on logistic transformation of daily temperatures, which proves a better fit and permits simple inclusion of additional variables such as relative humidity.

The initiation and development of a new generation are strongly controlled by temperature and a warmer climate may affect the number of generations that is produced per year and hence the outbreak dynamics. Experimental knowledge regarding reproductive diapause adaptations is, however, too sparse for large-scale assessments of future trends. We developed a model description of diapause induction, and used gridded observational temperature data to evaluate multiple combinations of day length and temperature thresholds to find the model parameterisation most coherent with I. typographus monitoring data from Scandinavia. The selected model parameterisation is supported by European literature data, though further experimental studies are required to analyse population specific adaptations and capacity for adjustments to changing climate conditions. Implementing the model description of reproductive diapause in a temperature driven model of bark beetle phenology (swarming activity and development from egg to mature bark beetle), enabled us to assess the length of the late summer swarming period that is a critical determinant of the risk of forest damage. By using regional climate model data we show that higher temperatures can result in increased frequency and length of late summer swarming events, producing a second generation in southern Scandinavia and a third generation in lowland parts of central Europe. Reproductive diapause will not prevent the occurrence of an additional generation per year, but the day length cues may restrict the length of the late summer swarming period.",no,,,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0165-0009,1573-1480,2011,10.1007/s10584-011-0038-4,WOS:000297350700025

The threat of this pest to regional small and stone fruit production industries led to investigations on its overwintering capabilities in fruit-growing regions in the Pacific Northwest. Knowledge of its cold tolerance will help in the development of computer models to forecast seasonal population growth and decline. RESULTS: Of 1500 adults or pupae, 22 (1.4%) individuals survived the 84 day experimental chilling period. Most (86%) of the survivors were subjected to 10 degrees C temperature treatments. Survival decreased significantly at lower temperature treatments. Freezing temporarily increased the mortality rate but did not significantly affect overall mortality over the trial period. Flies that emerged from pupae are estimated to survive for up to 103-105 days at 10 degrees C and for shorter periods at lower temperatures. Field trapping in five fruit production areas has demonstrated overwintering survival in California and Oregon, but lower survival is predicted in Eastern Washington and Michigan. CONCLUSION: The experiments reported here indicate that long-term survival of D. suzukii is unlikely at temperatures below 10 degrees C. Field data from five climatic regions indicated extended low initial D. suzukii field presence in 2010 in all regions except California, where field presence was recorded earlier.

In this study, we use an empirical model to relate the spatial distribution of past defoliation by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) in Ontario to bioclimatic variables. We then apply data from six climate change scenarios to this model to project potential changes in the distribution of defoliation for 2011-2040. The spatial distribution of historical defoliation was found to be related to winter maximum and minimum temperatures, forest content in balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and spring and summer minimum temperatures. All six climate change scenarios project broadly similar changes in the spatial patterns of defoliation: (i) an extension of the northern limit of defoliation as far as available data go or close to it, (ii) a decrease in the frequency of defoliation in the center of the historical defoliation belt, and (iii) a persistence of the southern limit of defoliation. This leads to a projected increase of the total area defoliated of between 22.8% and 25.5%, while the mean frequency of defoliation, calculated over the whole study area, would slightly increase (+1%) or decrease (-17.7% to -2.9%).",no,,,,,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0045-5067,1208-6037,2011,10.1139/X11-134,WOS:000297275500005

Incorporating spatial variables with population genetic statistics allows for greater discovery beyond traditional population genetics alone and can inform management decisions. The understanding of population structure in Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), a pest of wheat, has been limited in the past. We scored 14 microsatellite loci from 12 collections of Hessian fly in the southeastern United States. Through Bayesian clustering analysis, we found two major populations of Hessian fly covering the entire southeastern United States. We evaluated correlations between agriculturally significant spatial variables and population genetic differentiation to test if genetic structure has an ecological component in a wheat agro-ecosystem. Our results suggest the total amount of alternative host plants in the county may be driving some genetic differentiation. Although planting date may also be influential, geographic distance, mean annual temperature, and harvested wheat for grain do not seem to be contributing factors.

J,"Sandrock, C; Razmjou, J; Vorburger, C","Climate effects on life cycle variation and population genetic architecture of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae","Aphid species may exhibit different reproductive modes ranging from cyclical to obligate parthenogenesis. The distribution of life cycle variation in aphids is generally determined by ecological forces, mainly climate, because only sexually produced diapausing eggs can survive harsh winters or periods of absence of suitable host plants. Aphids are thus interesting models to investigate intrinsic and environmental factors shaping the competition among sexual and asexual lineages. We conducted a Europe-wide sampling of black bean aphids, Aphis fabae, and combined population genetic analyses based on microsatellite data with an experimental determination of life cycle strategies. Aphids were collected from broad beans (Vicia faba) as well as some Chenopodiaceae, but we detected no genetic differentiation between aphids from different host plants. Consistent with model predictions, life cycle variation was related to climate, with aphids from areas with cold winters investing more in sexual reproduction than aphids from areas with mild winters. Accordingly, only populations from mild areas exhibited a clear genetic signature of clonal reproduction. These differences arise despite substantial gene flow over large distances, which was evident from a very low geographic population structure and a lack of isolation-by-distance among 18 sites across distances of more than 1000 km. There was virtually no genetic differentiation between aphids with different reproductive modes, suggesting that new asexual lineages are formed continuously. Indeed, a surprising number of A. fabae genotypes even from colder climates produced some parthenogenetic offspring under simulated winter conditions. From this we predict that a shift to predominantly asexual reproduction could take place rapidly under climate warming.",no,,,,,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0962-1083,1365-294X,2011,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05242.x,WOS:000295230000018

RESULTS: The model consists of five components dealing with (a) the beginning of the post-dormancy development of overwintering eggs, (b) the egg hatching patterns, (c) the duration of first-instar nymphs, (d) the development and survival of subsequent instars and (e) the stochastic development of cohorts and their passage into the adult stage. Laboratory data permitted the parameterisation of temperature-dependent development and survival functions. Field data consisting mainly of beating tray catches allowed model parameterisation and validation. The model satisfactorily predicts the dynamics of age structures, the beginning as well as the pattern of egg hatching, the occurrence of the third instar and the emergence of adults. CONCLUSION: The phenology model is useful for timing IGR applications and for setting up monitoring activities in supervised S. titanus control.

In order to anticipate threats and prioritize management actions for H. hampei we present here, maps on future distributions of H. hampei in coffee producing areas of East Africa. Using the CLIMEX model we relate present-day insect distributions to current climate and then project the fitted climatic envelopes under future scenarios A2A and B2B (for HADCM3 model).

Since temperature is the major abiotic factor influencing insect development and thermal requirements may vary among insect populations, it is important to know the effect of temperature on development and survival of a subtropical strain of P. xylostella. Development and survival of the diamondback moth was evaluated under seven constant temperatures ranging from 10 degrees C to 35 degrees C. Development was completed between 10 degrees C and 32.5 degrees C, but at 35 degrees C all individuals died in the larval stage. Data were fitted to one linear and five nonlinear models. Considering as criteria the goodness of fit and the ability to estimate parameters of biological significance, the models Briere-1 and Briere-2 were the most adequate to describe the relationship between temperature and development of P. xylostella. The linear model demonstrated that P. xylostella required 312.5 degree-days above a lower threshold of 6.3 degrees C to complete development. The degree-day model showed that the number of diamondback moth generations in the tropical region of Brazil is nearly twice the number in the subtropical region of the country. This result explains, at least in part, the higher population levels of this species in the tropical region of Brazil, and also demonstrates that P. xylostella is tolerant to a wide range of temperatures (6.1-32.5 degrees C).

Larva feeding severely impairs the capacity of white clover to fix atmospheric nitrogen, by attacking the nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Development of the egg stage was studied at six different constant temperatures ranging from 9 to 30A degrees C to improve the basis for phenological forecasts. Development occurred over the entire range of temperatures, although hatching percentage at 30A degrees C was only 24.4% compared to 90.1% at 28.5A degrees C. Developmental time decreased with increase in temperature from 9 to 28.5A degrees C but increased markedly at 30A degrees C. At 28.5A degrees C, the embryo development period was the shortest (10.35 days); whereas at 9A degrees C, this parameter was the longest (55.08 days). Using linear regression, the lower threshold temperature was calculated 4.38A degrees C and the thermal constant was 236.45 degree-days. The relationship between constant temperature and developmental rate was evaluated using nine models.

Commonly used methods fall under the ambit of ecological niche models (ENMs). These methods were reviewed and shortcomings identified. Weather-driven physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs) are proposed that resolve many of the deficiencies of ENMs. The PBDM approach is used to analyze the invasiveness of the polyphagous glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis [Germar]), a pest native to the southeastern United States and northeastern Mexico that extended its range into California in 1989. Glassy-winged sharpshooter vectors the pathogenic bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa (Wells) that causes Pierce's disease in grape and scorch-like diseases in other plants. PBDMs for glassy-winged sharpshooter and its egg parasitoids (Gonatocerus ashmeadi Girault and G. triguttatus Girault) were developed and linked to a PBDM for grape published by Wermelinger et al. (1991). Daily weather data from 108 locations across California for the period 1995-2006 were used to drive the PBDM system, and GRASS GIS was used to map the simulation results. The geographic distribution of glassy-winged sharpshooter, as observed, is predicted to be largely restricted to the warm areas of southern California, with the action of the two egg parasitoids reducing its abundance >90%. The average indispensable mortality contributed by G. triguttatus is <1%. A temperature-dependent developmental rate model for X. fastidiosa was developed that suggests its geographic range is also limited to the warm inland areas of southern California. Biological control of glassy-winged sharpshooter further decreases the pathogen's relative range.

Three different day-degree models that were developed to predict the phenology of female oviposition in the spring were validated by comparing model results with field data on the timing of oviposition in previous years. The study suggests that P. vulgatissima may initiate a second generation in Sweden if development of the first generation is completed before August.

In the present study, we report on a case study of the European earwig Forficula auricularia L., which is an important natural enemy in pipfruit orchards, and describe how such a day degree model can be used to avoid negative effects of crucial orchard management, such as spray applications and soil tillage. A precise timing of these interventions in relation to the phenology of natural enemies will enhance biocontrol. 2 Earwig population dynamics are characterized by single- and double-brood populations, each with specific biological characteristics. 3 A day degree model capable of predicting the phenology of local earwig populations of both population types was developed. The model was checked for accuracy by comparing the first field observation dates of various life stages with predicted values using temperature data from the nearest weather station. In addition, variation in development time was assessed using field data. 4 The model was able to make predictions on a global scale. Although single- and double-brood populations differ in phenology, the predictions of first appearance dates were similar. Variation in development time showed that single-brood populations were more synchronized. 5 Our phenological model provides an accurate tool for predicting and simulating earwig population dynamics, as well as for enhancing the biocontrol of pests in pipfruit orchards.",no,,,,,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1461-9555,1461-9563,2011,10.1111/j.1461-9563.2011.00525.x,WOS:000292741000008

The influence of temperature on plasticity of life history and morphological traits of the soybean aphid has not been tested despite observable differences in population growth and morphology among isolates in laboratory colonies. Therefore, we used three isolates of the aphid to test whether lifespan, growth rate, fecundity, and morphology were plastic at 16, 24, and 28 degrees C. Population size of the aphid was influenced by temperature, probably because two reproductive traits, maximum number of offspring in 1 day and total fecundity, were plastic and increased in successive generations at 24 degrees C. All morphological traits were plastic, including lengths of body parts, number of antennal segments and caudal hairs, and color of siphunculi and body, and they were differentially influenced by isolate and temperature.

Results revealed that PNGM population dynamics were classified into five clusters based on the analysis of autocorrelation function and self-organizing map, which is an artificial neural network. We also quantified spatial synchrony in the population dynamics of PNGM using the nonparametric covariance function. Variation in spatial synchrony was strongly related to differences in maximum temperature and precipitation in Random Forest analysis, suggesting that the synchrony in PNGM population dynamics is largely the result of the Moran effect. In addition, spatial differences in population dynamics could be influenced by transient process of synchronization following invasion.

Climate-induced range expansions have been shown for two irruptive forest defoliators, the geometrids Operophtera brumata and Epirrita autumnata, causing more extensive forest damage in sub-Arctic Fennoscandia. Here, we document a rapid northwards expansion of a novel irruptive geometrid, Agriopis aurantiaria, into the same region, with the aim of providing insights into mechanisms underlying the recent geometrid range expansions and subsequent forest damage. Based on regional scale data on occurrences and a quantitative monitoring of population densities along the invasion front, we show that, since the first records of larval specimens in the region in 1997-1998, the species has spread northwards to approximately 70 degrees N, and caused severe defoliation locally during 2004-2006. Through targeted studies of larval phenology of A. aurantiaria and O. brumata, as well as spring phenology of birch, along meso-scale climatic gradients, we show that A. aurantiaria displays a similar dynamics and development as O. brumata, albeit with a consistent phenological lag of 0.75-1 instar. Experiments of the temperature requirements for egg hatching and for budburst in birch showed that this phenological lag is caused by delayed egg hatching in A. aurantiaria relative to O. brumata. A. aurantiaria had a higher development threshold (LDT(A.a.)=4.71 degrees C, LDT(O.b.)=1.41 degrees C), and hatched later and in less synchrony with budburst than O. brumata at the lower end of the studied temperature range. We can conclude that recent warmer springs have provided phenological match between A. aurantiaria and sub-Arctic birch which may intensify the cumulative impact of geometrid outbreaks on this forest ecosystem. Higher spring temperatures will increase spring phenological synchrony between A. aurantiaria and its host, which suggests that a further expansion of the outbreak range of A. aurantiaria can be expected.",no,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,NA,2011,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02370.x,WOS:000289641400006

In this study, stage frequency data were generated with B. tabaci in sweet pepper plants in various situations, and the Bellows and Birley method was used to obtain population parameters from the data. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to select the best option of the Bellows and Birley method and, in some cases, to estimate the parameters of the population using model averaging. The ratios estimated/observed for each population parameter were calculated to assess bias and were used to correct the estimations if the ratios were different from 1. The effects of different factors on the estimations of population parameters were analysed. The total duration of development was affected by the experimental conditions (laboratory vs. greenhouse) and temperature, but it had the highest precision. The final survival rate was affected by temperature, and the estimation of individuals entering each stage was affected only by the options included in the Bellows and Birley method.

Of interest from a pest management standpoint would be whether D. citri regularly disperses to or away from citrus on a predictable schedule. In research presented here, seasonal flight activity by D. citri was investigated using yellow sticky traps deployed in citrus trees and in fallow areas adjacent to citrus. Results indicated that flight activity by both male and female D. citri away from citrus can occur at any time of the year with consistent dispersal activity during the spring. The research further indicated citrus is continually subject to infestation by immigrating adults and that there is no time during the year that a citrus grower could be assured immigration would not occur. Growers should be aware that adult dispersal occurs regularly during spring and they should time management tactics accordingly. Adult flight activity 2 m from a citrus tree was more pronounced at 1 m above ground than at 2 or 3 m high. At distances of 8-60 m from trees, numbers of adults on traps were similar among the three heights. Males and females were similar with respect to seasonal flight activity. Numbers of adults captured on traps distant from citrus were not correlated with wind speed, sunlight, or air temperature, but there was some evidence that relative humidity influenced flight activity.

Captures of adult weevils in unbaited pyramid traps recorded annually from 2000 to 2008 in an unmanaged peach orchard in central Alabama were used to determine its seasonal occurrence and to develop predictive degree-day models. Spring migration of plum curculio began at bloom (early to mid-March). Linear, polynomial, and three-parameter Weibull functions were tested to describe the relationship between weekly trap capture and cumulative degree-day (DD). Criteria used to select the best models were the smallest Akaike information criterion and highest R-2 values. A sixth-order polynomial function fitted best to seasonal trap captures and cumulative DDs and revealed two major seasonal peaks with the first (spring generation) and second (summer generation) peaks occurring at cumulative DDs of approximate to 245 and 1105 (base 10 degrees C, biofix of 1 January), respectively. A potential third (late summer generation) peak was observed at 1758 DDs. The sixth-order polynomial model predicted the first trap capture to occur at cumulative DD of approximate to 99 (base 10 degrees C, biofix of 1 January). The three-parameter Weibull model predicted the first trap and first peak (spring generation) trap captures to occur at mean cumulative DDs of 108.02 +/- 9 and 220.07 +/- 16, respectively. Validation of the models in the unmanaged orchard in 2009 and 2010 and in a second unmanaged orchard (located 1.6 km from the first) in 2009 showed that the polynomial and Weibull were within +/- 7 d in their predictions of the first and peak trap captures of the spring population. Validation results showed that both models successfully predicted the first trap capture in one out of three scenarios and the peak trap capture in two out of three scenarios. The performance of the models is discussed in relation to management of plum curculio in central Alabama.",no,,,,,ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0013-8746,1938-2901,2011,10.1603/AN10061,WOS:000294062300011

Gaps exist in the knowledge about second generation breeding performance in bivoltine populations. In this study, the breeding performance of the second generation was evaluated in three bivoltine populations of I. typographus in the SE Alps. Length of the maternal galleries (from 40.5 to 44.8 mm), population growth rate (PGR; from 0.7 to 3.6), and emerged adults per m(2) (from 669 to 1,570 insects/m(2)) varied among populations and were negatively correlated with bark colonisation density. Pheromone traps set up in the three investigated forests differed in the number of trapped beetles, with mean captures ranging between 5,310 and 19,850 insects per trap. The populations giving the highest captures in the traps showed the lowest bark colonisation density (248 vs. 489 maternal galleries per m(2)) and the best breeding performance. The populations of parasitoids and predators corresponded to just 1-9 and 2-10% of the emerging I. typographus adults, respectively, and phloem temperature never reached thresholds lethal to I. typographus. Interspecific competition was negligible, whereas intraspecific competition was found to be the main factor affecting the breeding performance of the second generation, although with different intensity according to the colonisation density.

The present study characterized the population dynamics of both aphid species and their natural enemies on guava and ornamental figs in the Bajio region of Central Mexico. This report represents the first record of G. psiidi on Ficus sp. in Mexico and the first report of the presence of both species in the state of Guanajuato. Greenidea psiidi and G. ficicola were detected on guava in Mar 2007 and on fig trees during the same year in Apr near Irapauto, Guanajuato. Populations of both alate and apterous forms of G. psiidi in Apr were greater on guava than on fig trees (W = 119.0; P = 0.0122), which coincided with new vegetative growth after leaf loss in winter on guava. In Apr populations of apterous forms of both species were significantly greater than winged forms on both guava and figs. No correlation was found between temperature changes and population densities of aphids. The indigenous predators, Chrysoperla comanche Banks, Chrysoperla exotera (Navas) and Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), fed readily on the aphids and were found on both guava and fig trees, although densities of all 3 species were in greater numbers on Ficus. The combined population densities of the 3 predators had a positive correlation with that of G. ficicola (r = 0.74), with a best fit found with a quadratic model of simple regression: y (densities of Chrysoperla spp.) = 1.2479x(2) - 4.3073x + 9.6493, and R-2= 0.703.

We tested this prediction with large-scale empirical monitoring data for boreal moth communities. Location Finland, northern Europe. Methods Our data set comprised observations of multivoltine species made in the Finnish moth monitoring scheme 'Nocturna' trap sites during the period 1993-2006 along an exceptionally long latitudinal gradient of 1000 km. To compare recent changes in moth multivoltinism with a longer time period, we gathered older time series of moth observations from five locations. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to detect possible temporal and geographical trends in the annual occurrence of multivoltinism. We also identified areas where the recent changes in multivoltinism have been greatest. Monthly average temperatures of spring and summer periods and annual sum of growing degree days above 5 degrees C (GDD5) were used as explanatory variables to distinguish the main climatic correlates of moth multivoltinism. Results We observed a clear increase in the occurrence of moth multivoltinism during the period 1993-2006. The incidence as well as the recent increase in multivoltinism were highest in southernmost Finland and decreased towards the north. We also detected a weaker, although significantly positive, trend of moth multivoltinism in southern Finland during the period 1963-92, suggesting that this increasing trend might already have begun earlier. The most important climatic correlates for the annual occurrence of moth multivoltinism were the mean summer temperature (periods May-July and June-August) and GDD5, but all the tested climatic variables showed a significant univariate relationship with the occurrence of moth multivoltinism. All climatic variables showed an increasing trend during the period 1993-2006. Main conclusions The occurrence of multivoltinism has increased in northern European moth communities during recent decades, apparently as a response to increasing temperatures during the spring and summer seasons. The increase in multivoltinism was greatest in the southernmost parts of Finland, whereas in the northern landscapes recent warming has triggered multivoltinism in only relatively few moth species.",no,,,,,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1466-822X,NA,2011,10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00597.x,WOS:000286889500008

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of temperature on C. ciliata in the laboratory so that forecasting models based on heat accumulation units could be developed for the pest. Development and fecundity of C. ciliata reared on leaves of London plane tree (Platanus x acerifolia) were investigated at seven constant temperatures (16, 19, 22, 26, 30, 33, and 36 degrees C) and at a relative humidity of 80% with a photoperiod of 14: 10 (L: D). The developmental time was found to significantly decrease with increasing temperature. The developmental time from egg hatching to adult emergence was respectively 47.6, 35.0, 24.1, 20.0, and 17.1 days at the temperatures of 19, 22, 26, 30, and 33 degrees C. C. ciliata could not complete full development at 16 degrees and 36 degrees C. The developmental threshold temperature (C) estimated for egg-to-adult was 11.17 degrees C, with a thermal constant of (K) 370.57 degree-days. Longevity of females was found to be the shortest, 17.7 days at 33 degrees C and the longest, 58.9 days at 16 degrees C, and that of males was the shortest, 19.7 days at 33 degrees C and the longest, 9.7 days at 16 degrees C.

While reports of damage by these mites appear to have increased in the last decade, limited research has been conducted on their biology and ecology. Here the distribution and seasonal abundance patterns of Bryobia spp. and Ba. medicagoense in southern Australia are investigated. Bryobia spp. had a more widespread distribution than Ba. medicagoense. An Ecological Niche Model for the distribution of Ba. medicagoense constructed using MAXENT predicted the distribution of this species well, and identified associated climatic factors including summer and winter temperature variables and winter precipitation. Monthly sampling suggested that Ba. medicagoense had two generations per year and was active from March until December, with a likely diapause period in summer. The seasonal abundance and life cycle of two species of Bryobia (Bryobia sp. IX and Bryobia sp. I) differed. Bryobia sp. IX had two generations per year, was active from March until December, and was likely to be in diapause over summer. Bryobia sp. I did not appear to have a diapause stage, and had approximately four generations per year. Activity periods of these mites overlapped with those of the pest mite species Halotydeus destructor and Penthaleus major.

J,"Duehl, AJ; Koch, FH; Hain, FP","Southern pine beetle regional outbreaks modeled on landscape, climate and infestation history","The southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis, SPB) is the major insect pest of pine species in the southeastern United States. It attains outbreak population levels sufficient to mass attack host pines across the landscape at scales ranging from a single forest stand to interstate epidemics. This county level analysis selected and examined the best climatic and landscape variables for predicting infestations at regional scales. The analysis showed that, for a given county, the most important factor in predicting outbreaks was that the county was classified as in outbreak status in the previous year. Other important factors included minimum winter temperature and the greatest difference between the average of daily minimums and a subsequent low temperature point, precipitation history either seasonally in the previous year or difference from average over the previous 2 years, the synchronizing effect of seasonal temperatures on beetle populations and the relative percentage of total forest area composed of host species. The statistical models showed that climatic variables are stronger indicators of outbreak likelihood than landscape structure and cover variables. Average climatic conditions were more likely to lead to outbreaks than extreme conditions, supporting the notion of coupling between a native insect and its native host. Still, some extreme events (i.e., periods of very low temperature or very high precipitation) did precede beetle infestation. This analysis suggested that there are predisposing and inciting factors at the large scale but the driving factors leading to individual infestations operate at smaller scales.

In this study, effects of two insect growth regulators (pyriproxyfen & chlorfluazuron), temperature and overwintering were investigated on physiology and morphology of the larvae. In chlorfluazuron and pyriproxyfen treatments, longevity of the last larval instars with 20 and 30 days, respectively was significantly longer than the control with 9 days. Most of treated larvae molted to malformed prepupae and supernumerary larvae, respectively. No significant differences in total sugar and lipid were observed between pyriproxyfen, chlorfluazuron and control treatments, but glycogen content in chlorfluazuron treatment (5.78 +/- 0.66 mg/g fresh weight) was significantly lower than pyriproxyfen and control treatments (10.62 +/- 0.66 & 10.66 +/- 0.66 mg/g fresh weight, respectively).

In spite of containment efforts and the introduction of the predator Teretrius nigrescens Lewis from Mexico, LGB has spread to the main maize production zone in western Kenya during the past five years. The present work presents results from a 28-month monitoring effort of LGB and its predator, using pheromone traps at five locations along an east-west transect across Kenya. LGB occurred in all regions with highest trap catches in the high potential maize production zones in Western Kenya. T. nigrescens had not spread to western Kenya and trap catches were very low and mostly zero in Eastern Kenya, even in the area where it was released during the 1990s, suggesting that it became locally extinct after initial establishment. LGB flight activity was closely related to relative humidity, temperature and vapour pressure deficit. A model based on climatic factors accurately predicted seasonal trends of LGB flight behaviour in Kakamega and Mombasa but not in Kitale and Thika. It was concluded that models that rely on the direct effect of climate cannot predict LGB flight accurately enough to allow assessment of the impact of T. nigrescens on a regional basis. It is suggested that other factors such as the availability of stored grain and thus the indirect effect of climate via enhanced or reduced crop production play a major role in the flight activity of LGB and T. nigrescens.

During these years, almost all insect pest populations showed marked changes, which may be the result of changes in forest management, shifts in forest composition, climate change and the arrival of new pests from the Mediterranean region or from other continents. In order to generate hypothesis about possible relationships between species ecology and environmental factors, we have analyzed 61 years of population development of the 98 most abundant species in the database while paying attention to life history traits and preferred host plants. The 22 species with infestations lasting a few years only were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 76 species, 18 were present over the entire observation period of 61 years. Of the other species, 27 showed a decline and 31 showed an increase. On coniferous trees most species showed decreasing populations. Increasing populations were found most on deciduous trees. Not directly climate-related factors such as changes in forest age, tree composition and forest management were identified as the most important causes for the fluctuations in pest insect populations. Climate change is a possible driver of the population increase in Thaumetopoea processionea. Haematoloma dorsatum and of the population decrease in Euproctis chrysorrhoea. The recently increasing exotic species Eupulvinaria hydrangeae and Pulvinaria regalis were exclusively found on trees in cities, presumably in relation to the higher temperatures of the urban habitat.

Degree-day models were used to project mean generation numbers for codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.), navel orangeworm (Amyelois transitella Walker), two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and European red mite (Panonychus ulmi Koch). In the Central Valley, the number of codling moth generations predicted for degree days accumulated between April 1 and October 1 rose from 2-4 in 1950 to 3-5 among all future scenarios. Generation numbers increased from 10-18 to 14-24 for two-spotted spider mite, from 9-14 to 14-20 for European red mite, and from 2-4 to up to 5 for navel orangeworm. Overall pest pressure can thus be expected to increase substantially. Our study did not include the possibility of higher winter survival rates, leading to higher initial pest counts in spring, or of extended pest development times in the summer, factors that are likely to exacerbate future pest pressure. On the other hand, initiation of diapause may prevent an extension of the season length for arthropods, and higher incidence of heat death in summer may constrain pest population sizes.

Although a few studies have investigated the factors affecting diapause intensity, little attention has been paid to the physiological alterations and metabolic regulation that take place during diapause. Here, we describe differences in diapause between a highland and a coastal Greek population of the European cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cerasi, a major pest of sweet and sour cherries in many European countries. Pupae of both populations were exposed to the environmental conditions prevailing in the two areas and diapause termination was observed under laboratory conditions. The regulation of energetic metabolites during the long pupae stage was examined under both field and laboratory conditions. Differences in diapause intensity revealed that the two populations have adapted to the local geographical and climatic conditions and have different requirements for low temperatures to terminate diapause. The coastal population undergoes a shorter diapause and adults emerge more rapidly, especially in the highland area. The highland population failed to terminate diapause (<40% adult emergence) in the coastal area. Both populations draw on their major energetic reserves (lipids and protein) similarly during diapause. Nevertheless, regulation of carbohydrate and glycogen reserves seems to vary between the populations: major peaks of these stored nutrients occur on different dates in the two populations, suggesting a differential regulation. Differences in diapause intensity imply a genetic differentiation between the two populations. The importance of our findings in understanding the physiological patterns during obligatory diapause of a univoltine insect species, as well as the practical implications for the development of specific phenological models for the European cherry fruit fly are discussed.

The results showed that this insect reproduces in decaying trees or trunks in the soil with low humidity content. This insect showed greater flight activity when temperature was higher, and precipitation and relative humidity were lower. A description of the life stages was made and we estimated that a complete cycle might last more than 48 days and, that eggs could require around 28 days in order to develop into an adult.

The pest damage is notoriously increasing in potato crops in Cusco. The pest is expanding to other potato cultivation environments, noticing the increase use of pesticides. The interest of this work was to define the methodology on how to work with this new potato pest. To do these observations in the field and laboratory were made. To study the pest biology, larvae and adults were collected in different potato producing areas. The field samples were taken to the laboratory and processed at room temperature (13 degrees-16 degrees C). Under these environ-mental conditions observations were made on deve-lopment of larval instars, pupation and adult biology. In well identified potato fields direct observations were made in timing and the duration of adult's sexual copulation, place in the plant where eggs were deposited, damages, form of the larvae and the place of pupation. It was determined that the biological cycle of Tequus sp. was of 47 - 58 days; the adult has day activity; the female puts eggs in the back's leaf, being capable of putting an average of 60 eggs for female. The first instar larvae live in the back's leaf, and they rasp/scars the parenquima. In the following other instars they chew to leave the leaf. After finishing their larval development, the worms fall to the floor, enter to the to the interior and generate the pupa.

J,"Terblanche, JS; Nyamukondiwa, C; Kleynhans, E","Thermal variability alters climatic stress resistance and plastic responses in a globally invasive pest, the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata)","Climatic means with different degrees of variability (delta) may change in the future and could significantly impact ectotherm species fitness. Thus, there is an increased interest in understanding the effects of changes in means and variances of temperature on traits of climatic stress resistance. Here, we examined short-term (within-generation) variation in mean temperature (23, 25, and 27 degrees C) at three levels of diel thermal fluctuations (delta = 1, 3, or 5 degrees C) on an invasive pest insect, the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Using the adult flies, we address the hypothesis that temperature variability may affect the climatic stress resistance over and above changes in mean temperature at constant variability levels. We scored the traits of high- and low-thermal tolerance, high- and low-temperature acute hardening ability, water balance, and egg production under benign conditions after exposure to each of the nine experimental scenarios. Most importantly, results showed that temperature variance may have significant effects in addition to the changes in mean temperature for most traits scored. Although typical acclimation responses were detected for most of the traits under low variance conditions, high variance scenarios dramatically altered the outcomes, with poorer climatic stress resistance detected in some, but not all, traits. These results suggest that large temperature fluctuations might limit plastic responses which in turn could reduce the insect fitness. Increased mean temperatures in conjunction with increased temperature variability may therefore have stronger negative effects on this agricultural pest than elevated temperatures alone. The results of this study therefore have significant implications for understanding insect responses to climate change and suggest that analyses or simulations of only mean temperature variation may be inappropriate for predicting population-level responses under future climate change scenarios despite their widespread use.",no,,,,,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0013-8703,1570-7458,2010,10.1111/j.1570-7458.2010.01067.x,WOS:000284171700012

(Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) close to the species' northern range limit in Japan. Insects are reared from October to June under quasi-natural (i.e. ambient outdoor) conditions and in a transparent incubator, in which climate warming is simulated by adding 2.5 degrees C to the ambient temperatures. Despite the earlier assumption that females of N. viridula overwinter in diapause, whereas males do so in quiescence, regular dissections show that the two sexes overwinter in a state of true diapause. During winter, both sexes are dark-coloured and have undeveloped reproductive organs. Resumption of development does not start until late March. During winter, the effect of simulated warming on the dynamics and timing of physiological processes appears to be limited. However, the warming significantly enhances winter survival (from 27-31% to 47-70%), which is a key factor in range expansion of N. viridula. In spring, the effect of simulated warming is complex. It advances the post-diapause colour change and transition from dormancy to reproduction. The earlier resumption of development is more pronounced in females: in April, significantly more females are already in a reproductive state under the simulated warming than under quasi-natural conditions. In males, the tendency is similar, although the difference is not significant. Warming significantly enhances spring survival and percentage of copulating adults, although not the percentage of ovipositing females and fecundity. The results suggest that, under the expected climate-warming conditions, N. viridula will likely benefit mostly as a result of increased winter and spring survival and advanced post-diapause reproduction. Further warming is likely to allow more adults to survive the critical cold season and contribute (both numerically and by increasing heterogeneity) to the post-overwintering population growth, thus promoting the establishment of this species in newly-colonized areas.",no,,,,,PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0307-6962,1365-3032,2010,10.1111/j.1365-3032.2010.00748.x,WOS:000284273600006

Larch budmoth (LBM) population dynamics across the European Alps, a classic example of regular outbreaks, inexplicably changed sometime during the 1980s after 1,200 y of nearly uninterrupted periodic outbreak cycles. Herein, analysis of perhaps the most extensive spatiotemporal dataset of population dynamics and reconstructed Alpine-wide LBM defoliation records reveals elevational shifts in LBM outbreak epicenters that coincide with temperature fluctuations over two centuries. A population model supports the hypothesis that temperature-mediated shifting of the optimal elevation for LBM population growth is the mechanism for elevational epicenter changes. Increases in the optimal elevation for population growth over the warming period of the last century to near the distributional limit of host larch likely dampened population cycles, thereby causing the collapse of a millennium-long outbreak cycle.

None of the weather variables that were evaluated (viz, maximum and minimum temperatures, and rainfall) significantly impacted parasitism ratios. Shade cover moderated on-farm temperatures, by reducing maximum daily temperatures and any potential, direct impacts of rainfall on coffee leafminer, by providing partial shelter from rainfall, but did not significantly affect coffee leafminer incidence. In 48 h laboratory trials, coffee leafminer oviposition was highest at 28 degrees C (similar to 15 eggs/female), minimal at 25 degrees C (similar to 3 eggs) and nil at 20 degrees C, and higher during night-time hours (>8 eggs/female/day) compared to daytime hours (<1 egg). Historical average temperatures were higher at low elevation (yearly average ca. 25 degrees C; range = 18.0-32.0 degrees C) than at high elevation (ca. 21 degrees C; 13.5-28.5 degrees C), and we predicted that physical environmental conditions (i.e. night-time hours with temperatures >20 degrees C) were permissive of coffee leafminer oviposition during twice as many hours each year at low elevation (4060 h) compared to high elevation (2081 h).

The present study examines the factors controlling the emergence of males in the laboratory. There are two steps involved. Standby behaviour (i.e. insect head appears at the soil surface) can be observed for several hours before the beetles actually emerge for mating. The standby behaviour is facilitated by warm conditions, although the proportion of standby individuals is influenced not only by the temperature on that day, but also by that on the previous day. Experiments in which beetles are exposed to photoperiod and thermoperiod combinations, in and out of phase, show that temperature is more important in inducing standby and emerging behaviour than light alone. For the second step, factors such as temperature, light and the presence of the female sex pheromone determine whether males will leave the standby position and emerge onto the ground. The female sex pheromone stimulates standby beetles to exhibit emerging and wing vibration behaviours, although the effect depends on when it is presented to beetles. Beetles burrow back into the soil; this behaviour is influenced by illumination and time of the day but not by temperature. The results suggest that D. ishigakiensis possesses a sophisticated mechanism controlling male emergence from the soil.",no,,,,,PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0307-6962,1365-3032,2010,10.1111/j.1365-3032.2010.00733.x,WOS:000280999000004

'Standby behaviour' (i.e. adults come to the soil surface where they expose their heads) is shown in the field and, along with emergence behaviour, is entrained by LD photocycles. These 24-h rhythms persist after transfer to continuous light conditions for 2 days. By contrast, beetles transferred from LD photocycles to continuous dark conditions fail to show standby behaviour; thus, it appears to be manifested only in the presence of illumination. Under dark conditions, beetles emerge completely from the soil directly at the time when standby behaviour is otherwise expected to occur. Emerged adults then burrow back into the soil before dawn. Virgin and mated males, as well as virgin females, which are expected to emerge from the soil for mating on later evenings, burrow to a relatively shallow depth (< 2 cm), whereas mated females burrow deeper (2-10 cm).

A computer model is developed to simulate the population dynamics of H. armigera over a wide area in northern China. The area considered covers 12 provinces where serious outbreaks of H. armigera have been observed. In this model, pest development is driven by local ambient temperature, and adults migrate long distances between regions and select preferred hosts for oviposition within a region. Six types of host including cotton, wheat, corn, peanut, soybean and a single category composed of all other minor hosts are considered in this model. Survival rates of eggs and larvae are based on life-table data, and simulated as a function of host type, host phenology and temperature. The incidence of diapause depends on temperature and photoperiod experienced during the larval stage. Survival rate of non-diapause pupae is a nonlinear function of rainfall, and overwinter survival rate is a nonlinear function of temperature. Insecticide is applied when population density exceeds the economic threshold on a host crop within a region. Comparisons of model output with light-trap data indicate that our model reflects the pest population dynamics over a wide area, and could potentially be used for testing novel pest control strategies in northern China.

In Spain, there is observational evidence that the moth Lobesia botrana Den. & Schiff. (Lep.: Tortricidae), a key vine pest that is usually trivoltine in Mediterranean latitudes, tends to advance spring emergence, displaying a partial fourth additional flight, a fact that is potentially attributable to global warming. To verify this hypothesis, local temperatures were correlated with L. botrana phenology in six vine-growing areas of southwestern Spain during the last two decades (1984-2006) by exploiting the database of flight curves obtained with sexual pheromone traps. The dates of second and third flight peaks of the moth were calculated for each area and year and then correlated with both time (years) and local temperatures. The results obtained demonstrated a noteworthy trend towards local warming (as a result of global warming) in the last two decades, with mean increases in annual and spring temperatures of 0.9 and 3.0 degrees C, respectively. Therefore, L. botrana phenology has significantly advanced by more than 12 days. Moreover, the phenological advance contributed to increased moth voltinism in 2006 by promoting a complete fourth additional flight, a fact that has never been reported previously to our knowledge in the Iberian Peninsula. The potential impact of an earlier phenology and increased voltinism in L. botrana is discussed from an agro-ecological perspective.",no,,,,,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1461-9555,1461-9563,2010,10.1111/j.1461-9563.2009.00465.x,WOS:000276405400006

Lam. and this weevil is a target of an eradication program using the Sterile Insect Technique in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Understanding the population ecology is essential in the planning of an eradication program; hence, a host-plant infestation survey and light trap survey have been conducted to monitor the population dynamics of the weevil on Kume Island (Okinawa Prefecture), which is the target area of the trial weevil eradication project. Seasonal tendencies of weevil density were found in these field surveys, but the tendency found in the host-plant infestation survey was not seen every year, and the effectiveness of the light trap is somewhat suspect. To confirm the reliability of the tendency observed in these field surveys, the present study attempted to explain the tendency by a seasonal temperature change using a temperature-based model of weevil population dynamics. The seasonal changes of weevil density differed according to host plants and host-plant fields. The seasonal changes of weevil density inside the host plant Ipomoea indica and outside the host plants in I. indica fields were consistent with those predicted by the model. However, those inside the host plant Ipomoea pes-caprae in the host-plant infestation survey were contrary to the predicted ones, and those observed outside host plants in I. pes-caprae fields by the light trap survey were not in good agreement with the predicted ones.

J,"Altermatt, F",Climatic warming increases voltinism in European butterflies and moths,"Climate change is altering geographical ranges, population dynamics and phenologies of many organisms. For ectotherms, increased ambient temperatures frequently have direct consequences for metabolic rates, activity patterns and developmental rates. Consequently, in many insect species both an earlier beginning and prolongation of seasonal duration occurred in parallel with recent global warming. However, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, the number of generations (voltinism) and investment into each generation may be even more important than seasonality, since an additional generation per unit time may accelerate population growth or adaptation. Using a dataset extending back to the mid-nineteenth century, I report changes in the voltinism of butterfly and moth species of Central Europe. A significant proportion of 263 multi-voltine species showed augmented frequency of second and subsequent generations relative to the first generation in a warm period since 1980, and 44 species even increased the number of generations after 1980. Expected ecological consequences are diverse. Since multi-voltinism has been linked to insect outbreaks they include an increase in the abundance of herbivorous pests of agriculture and forestry. However, disruption of the developmental synchrony associated with multi-voltinism and host plant phenology may also reduce fitness, potentially having unexpected consequences for species of conservation concern.

The optimal oviposition theory, i.e., the preference-performance hypothesis, has thus far mainly been tested with a focus on nutritional quality of the host. This study investigates whether female oriental fruit moth Grapholita (Cyclic) molesta choose a microhabitat for oviposition characterized by a temperature range within which their offspring perform best. Thermal preferences of females during oviposition were assessed in a circular temperature gradient arena. Offspring performance and survival were assessed under different constant temperature conditions. Females preferred oviposition sites of similar to 30 degrees C over lower and higher temperatures. At this temperature, egg, larval, and pupal development was significantly faster than at 22 and 25 degrees C, and larval development was also faster than at 33 degrees C. At 30 degrees C and at the lower temperatures tested, survival of eggs and larvae was significantly higher than at 33 degrees C, whereas development was precluded at 35 degrees C. Furthermore, female pupal weight attained at 30 and 33 degrees C exceeded that reached at the lower temperatures tested. Considering the potentially reduced predation risk caused by the shorter developmental time of eggs and larvae, the laboratory data suggest that this species maximizes its fitness by selecting a thermally optimal environment for its offspring, supporting the optimal oviposition theory.

Accurate phenological models can be used to time scouting efforts and pesticide applications. The relationship between phenological data and accumulated DD fit nonlinear, Gaussian distributions better than uniform distributions. Phenological models were developed to describe these distributions for pupation, adult presence within the stalk and adult emergence.

We used temperatures of 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, and 32 +/- 1 degrees C (50 +/- 10% RH) and relative humidity values of 30,50,70, and 90 +/- 10% (25 +/- 1 degrees C) under a 14 L:10 D photoperiod. Adult longevity decreased as temperature and relative humidity increased and was greater, in general, for females. The preoviposition and oviposition periods also decreased as temperature increased, whereas relative humidity only caused reductions in the oviposition period at higher levels. Fecundity was similar in the range from 18 to 30 degrees C but decreased at 32 degrees C with respect to relative humidity; the best performances of L. sativae occurred at lower levels. The pattern of oviposition rate changed with temperature and relative humidity. Regardless of temperature and relative humidity, L, sativae laid between 75 and 92% of its eggs on the adaxial surface of the cowpea leaves.

B,"Kindlmann, P; Dixon, AFG",Modelling Population Dynamics of Aphids and Their Natural Enemies,"Aphids are serious pests of many agricultural crops. Therefore, a good understanding of their population dynamics is vitally important for crop protection. There have been several attempts made to forecast the abundance of aphids and develop expert systems to help farmers optimize prophylactic measures and minimize their costs. The advisory systems, however, did not receive general acceptance and disappointingly few forecasting systems are in use. The failure of models to predict aphid population dynamics for practical purposes is due to the extremely wild oscillations in aphid numbers caused by intrinsic (size, fecundity, mortality, migration rate) and external factors (weather, especially temperature). As a consequence, the predictions are unlikely to be robust enough for reliable forecasting, mainly because they depend on the course of weather during the season, which cannot be predicted. Here we present a critical review of existing models of aphid population dynamics, examine biological assumptions that are incorporated in the models and present one of the latest models of aphid metapopulation dynamics. We conclude that natural enemies are unlikely to affect aphid population dynamics late in the season, but may have an effect very early in the season, when aphid colonies are still small and predators might be able to reduce the numbers of these colonies. Empirical verification of this is still very weak, however, and further experiments on this aspect of predator prey dynamics should be undertaken.",no,,,,,APHID BIODIVERSITY UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: PATTERNS AND PROCESSES,NA,NA,7th International Symposium on Aphids,"OCT 02-07, 2005","Freemantle, AUSTRALIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,2010,10.1007/978-90-481-8601-3_1,WOS:000395360600001
B,"Michaud, JP",Implications of Climate Change for Cereal Aphids on the Great Plains of North America,"The Great Plains of North America represent a vast expanse of fertile land characterized by extreme weather conditions, generally limited rainfall, and long distance migration of insect pests, including aphid species that are especially damaging to graminaceous crops. An increase in annual mean temperatures would have certain predictable consequences for cereal aphid populations via direct effects on aphid biology, and indirectly through effects on plants and natural enemies. However, any sustained shift in prevailing wind patterns associated with atmospheric warming could generate an unpredictable cascade of ecological consequences for both agriculture and cereal aphids, mediated largely by changes in rainfall patterns and migration pathways, respectively. The direct effects of warming would be generally beneficial for aphids through most of the year, except in summer when high temperatures are already limiting to survival in much of the region. Additional indirect effects will be mediated by changes in the phenology of cereal crops and wild host plants, adjustment of agronomic practices, and likely impacts on natural enemies. Possible adverse consequences for agriculture include northern range expansions of pest aphid species, prolonged periods of asexual reproduction in autumn, improved survival of overwintering eggs, earlier development of spring populations, and more efficient virus transmission over greater distances.",no,,,,,APHID BIODIVERSITY UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: PATTERNS AND PROCESSES,NA,NA,7th International Symposium on Aphids,"OCT 02-07, 2005","Freemantle, AUSTRALIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,2010,10.1007/978-90-481-8601-3_5,WOS:000395360600005
B,"Clement, SL; Husebye, DS; Eigenbrode, SD",Ecological Factors Influencing Pea Aphid Outbreaks in the US Pacific Northwest,"This chapter documents the history of pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)) outbreaks in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, with particular attention to the periodicity of outbreaks on field peas (Pisum sativum L.) in the Palouse region of eastern Washington over a 26 year period (1983-2008). In the Palouse region, grain legume crops are devastated by pea aphid feeding damage and legume viruses during outbreak years. Various abiotic and biotic factors and their possible controlling influence on changes in pea aphid densities, with emphasis on winter temperatures within the context of climate change, are presented and discussed. Mild winters, long thought to herald spring pea aphid outbreaks, are defined and related to outbreak cycles. While the 26-year database does not demonstrate a consistent link between mild winters and pea aphid outbreaks, it reveals a certain periodicity with outbreaks occurring every 6-9 years in the Palouse region. Warming winter temperatures over several years bridging the 20th and 21st centuries could potentially compress the frequency of outbreaks by accelerating aphid population development on legumes that provide migrants that colonize peas and other spring-sown food legumes in this region. Large plantings of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) 60-120 km west and southwest of the Palouse region are thought to be the source of alate aphids that migrate northeast and attain outbreak densities in some years. In conclusion, this chapter delivers a new long-term data set that will improve our understanding of how different abiotic and biotic factors influence the life-history processes of pest aphids.",yes,field,abundance,,,APHID BIODIVERSITY UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: PATTERNS AND PROCESSES,NA,NA,7th International Symposium on Aphids,"OCT 02-07, 2005","Freemantle, AUSTRALIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,2010,10.1007/978-90-481-8601-3_7,WOS:000395360600007

For the control of B. tryoni using sterile insect technique (SIT), either pupae or adults may be released. Using pupal release, this study tested the seasonal effect of different pupal loadings on eclosion and the flight of sterile B. tryoni. Pupal eclosion boxes were loaded with either 200, 350, 500, 650 or 800 g of pupae during five periods of the fruit fly season (August, October, December, February and April). Adult flies were allowed to emerge and the remaining pupal debris was sampled to determine the per cent emergence and per cent fliers. The duration of emergence, dye retention on the ptilinum of the flies, and temperature and relative humidity externally and internally of the eclosion boxes were recorded. The percentage of emergence was influenced by both pupal loading and the period of release. Overall, the percentage of emergence was lower for loadings of 200 and 350 g of pupae in August, October and April as compared with the 500 g or higher loadings. This difference was not apparent in December or February. The mean percentage of emergence for each pupal loading in December, February and April was well above 65%, the minimum required emergence parameter for successful sterile B. tryoni release. Across all pupal loadings, the percentage of fliers was greater than 99.3% in December, 87.8% in February and 80.8% in April. A high percentage of fliers (> 92.7%) was recorded in October, but the percentage of emergence in August and October was below 65% for all pupal loadings; thus pupal release is a suboptimal SIT method during this period of time. Dye on the ptilinum was detected on every fruit fly sampled across all pupal loadings and release periods. Minimum temperature for optimal pupal emergence should not fall below 10 degrees C, and the maximum should not exceed 35 degrees C. Minimum temperature for successful flight should not fall below approximately 6 degrees C while the maximum temperature should exceed 16 degrees C. The described pupal release system is considered a possible option for use as part of an SIT program against B. tryoni under suitable environmental conditions in Australia.",no,,,,,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1326-6756,1440-6055,2010,10.1111/j.1440-6055.2009.00740.x,WOS:000277913500007

While inter-seasonal weather variability and consequent fluctuations of individual pest species are well-known phenomena, changes in overall climate conditions and associated range shifts of particular species have likewise become important areas of research, especially during the last decade. The present study demonstrates the methodology and benefits of climate-driven modelling tools using the European corn borer (ECB) Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner, 1796) and Colorado potato beetle (CPB) Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say, 1824) as examples. CLIMEX models of the potential geographical distributions of each species were created and validated under present climate conditions. Both models were then used to study the effects of climate change on ECB and CPB by estimating changes in population dynamics and/or infestation pressure during the first half of the 21st century. Simulations were conducted using 3 global circulation models (HadCM3, NCAR-PCM, and ECHAM4) and scaled by low and high values of global temperature change. The results predict an increase in newly established areas and in the number of pest generations per year. The ratio of arable land affected by a particular number of generations is also expected to increase. Under the HadCM3-high 2050 scenario, this ratio increases by about 43 and 48% for the second generations of CPB and ECB, respectively. Another significant result is shown for higher altitudes currently unoccupied by pests.

Phenological and life-history responses to simulated climate change of the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae),"The effect of simulated climate change on Nezara viridula was studied close to the species' northern range limit in Japan. Insects from the same egg masses were reared for 15 months in 10 consecutive series under quasi-natural (i.e. outdoor) conditions and in a transparent incubator, in which climate warming was simulated by adding 2.5 degrees C to the outdoor temperature. The warming strongly affected all life-history and phenological parameters. In the spring, the simulated warming advanced the timing of postdiapause body colour changes and reproduction. In the early summer, it increased egg production and accelerated nymphal development. In the late summer (the hottest season), the effect of the simulated warming was strongly deleterious: nymphs developed slowly, suffered higher mortality and had difficulties during final moulting; the emerged females were smaller, some exhibited abnormal cuticle, produced fewer eggs and had a decreased life span. In the autumn, the warming accelerated nymphal development, resulted in larger female size, affected the timing of the diapause-associated adult body colour change from green to russet and enhanced preparation for overwintering. Larger females had higher winter survival rate than smaller females. The warming strongly increased survival rate in both size classes and allowed smaller females to reach the same winter survival rate as larger females had under the quasi-natural conditions. The winter survival also differed between the green and dark-coloured females under the quasi-natural, but not under the warming conditions. However, under the warming conditions, green females survived the winter even better than dark-coloured females did under the quasi-natural conditions. The warming also shortened the life span of females from the summer generations and prolonged it in those from the autumn generation. It is concluded that even a moderate temperature increase (+ 2.5 degrees C) in the future is likely to have a complex influence upon insects, strongly affecting many of their life-history and phenological parameters.",yes,experimental,greenhouse,fecundity,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,1365-2486,2010,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01914.x,WOS:000274419200007

We consider species currently present within this broad region as well as species that are expected to move into or out of the area as climate zones shift northward through the coming century. Our analysis draws upon disparate data sources to compile projections. We conclude that a complex mixture of land use poses particular challenges to natural ecosystems in this region under climate change. Dispersal is likely to be limited for some species, and some populations of native taxa may already be reduced due to habitat loss. Other species can persist, even thrive, within a mixed landscape mosaic, provided natural areas and green spaces are available. If such spaces are somehow connected, they can provide opportunities for native species to inhabit and move through the metropolitan region (perhaps even better than the landscapes previously dominated by agriculture). Strategies for adapting regional agriculture and minimizing pest outbreaks also call for creative management intervention.

The Adelphocoris group primarily consists of three species: A. suturalis, A. fasciaticollis and A. lineolatus, which greatly differ in geographical distribution and seasonal dynamics. However, the underlying drivers of these differences remain to be understood. The study of flight behaviour of these three species can yield important insight into their spatial and temporal dynamics and help explain their distribution. We examined flight propensity of the three Adelphocoris spp. under a range of biological and environmental conditions using a computer-monitored flight-mill. Gender and mating status only had minor effects on flight performance in these species, while age exerted great effects on it. Flight capacity was low for one-day-old adults and increased with age until day 10-13, then gradually decreased afterwards. Temperature and relative humidity affected flight propensity, with 20-23 degrees C and 64-68% RH considered optimal for flight of all three species. Between-species comparisons indicated that A. suturalis and A. fasciaticollis had similar flight distance and duration, which were significantly greater than for A. lineolatus.

The model used daily cohorts (individuals of the same developmental stage and, daily age) as the population unit. Stage transitions were modeled as a logistic function of accumulated degree-days to account for variability in development rate among individuals. Daily survival was modeled as a logistic function of daily mean temperature. Parameters for development, survival, and fecundity were estimated from published data. A single invasion event was used to initiate the population process, starting at 1-100 d after onion emergence (DAE) for 10-100 d at the daily rate of 0.001-0.9 adults/plant/d. The model was validated against five observed seasonal patterns of onion thrips populations from two unsprayed sites in the Riverina, New South Wales, Australia, during 2003-2006. Performance of the model was measured by a fit index based on the proportion of variations in observed data explained by the model (R(2)) and the differences in total thrips-days between observed and predicted populations. Satisfactory matching between simulated and observed seasonal patterns was obtained within the ranges of invasion parameters tested. Model best-fit was obtained at invasion starting dates of 6-98 DAE with a daily invasion rate of 0.002-0.2 adults/plant/d and an invasion duration of 30-100 d. Under the best-fit invasion scenarios, the model closely reproduced the observed seasonal patterns, explaining 73-95% of variability in adult and larval densities during population increase periods. The results showed that small invasions of adult thrips followed by a gradual population build-up of thrips within onion crops were sufficient to bring about the observed seasonal patterns of onion thrips populations in onion.

Olive (Olea europaea) is of eco-social importance in the Mediterranean where it was domesticated. This drought-resistant crop and its major pest, the olive fly (Bactrocera oleae), have tight biological links that make them a suitable model system for climate change studies in the Mediterranean. Here a physiologically based weather-driven demographic model of olive and olive fly is used to analyze in detail this plant-pest system in Sardinia under observed weather (10 years of daily data from 48 locations), three climate warming scenarios (increases of 1, 2 and 3 degrees C in average daily temperature), and a 105-year climate model scenario for the Alghero location (e.g. 1951-2055). grass gis is used to map model predictions of olive bloom dates and yield, total season-long olive fly pupae, and percent fruit attacked by the fly. Island wide simulation data are summarized using multivariate regression. Model calibration with field bloom date data were performed to increase simulation accuracy of olive flowering predictions under climate change. As climate warms, the range of olive is predicted to expand to higher altitudes and consolidate elsewhere, especially in coastal areas. The range of olive fly will extend into previously unfavorable cold areas, but will contract in warm inland lowlands where temperatures approach its upper thermal limits. Consequently, many areas of current high risk are predicted to have decreased risk of fly damage with climate warming. Simulation using a 105-year climate model scenario for Alghero, Sardinia predicts changes in the olive-olive fly system expected to occur if climate continued to warm at the low rate observed during in the past half century.",no,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,1365-2486,2009,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01938.x,WOS:000271710300006

Leucinodes orbonalis is the key pest infesting eggplant, with international importance as it causes heavy damage in all eggplant growing areas. It is very difficult to control this pest since it feeds inside the shoot and fruit, and there is every possibility of toxic residues remaining in the fruits as they are harvested at frequent intervals and are consumed after little cooking. In the sub-himalayan region of West Bengal, India the pest was found to be most active during summer and the rainy season, particularly during May-August, and caused 49.5-81.0% damage to fruits. Peak infestation (81.0% fruit damage) was noticed in the first week of June (22nd standard week), when the mean temperature, mean relative humidity and weekly rainfall were 27.8A degrees C, 79.2% and 81.2 mm respectively.

In addition, a walk-in light trap was used to study the flight behavior of adult moths. On both cereals and grasses, the noctuid Sesamia calamistis was the predominant species, followed by the pyralid Eldana saccharina. The noctuid Busseola fusca was rare on both maize and wild host plants. In general, pest populations increased during the course of the year to reach peak densities during the second short rainy season, and then crashed to close to zero during the dry season. On wild host plants, egg masses and other immature stages were collected throughout the year but they were higher on wild grasses than maize during the off-season. Thus wild host plants can be considered as refuge for both borers and natural enemies during the off-season, when maize is not available. However, only four out of the eleven wild host species played a discernable role. S. calamistis egg densities appeared to be influenced by density-dependent factors, suggesting an effect of natural enemies. Temperature and rainfall had a negative effect on egg abundance. Larval parasitism by a Kenyan strain of the braconid Cotesia sesamiae, which was released in southern Benin in the early 1990s, and by the tachinid Sturmiopsis parasitica varied between seasons and years but there were no discernable patterns. For both parasitoids and borer host species, parasitism was positively correlated with trap catches of adult moths.

Moench. Greenbugs extract juice and inject toxin, killing seedlings or limiting the yield of older plants. Understanding greenbug biology and how biotypes develop is important for evaluating and developing sorghum with durable resistance. Prereproductive period, fecundity, and longevity of greenbug biotypes E and I were assessed on susceptible 'RTx430' sorghum at four cycling temperatures of 10-23, 14-27, 18-31, and 22-35 degrees C in an incubator. A photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h corresponded with daily warm and cool temperatures. Greenbug fitness was more affected by temperature than biotype. Greenbug prereproductive period, total fecundity, and longevity did not differ among temperature regimes except at the warmest regime (22-35 degrees C), at which all parameters were greater for biotype E than biotype I. The prereproductive period of greenbug biotypes E and I combined was more than twice as long at the coolest temperature of 10-23 degrees C as at 22-35 degrees C. Greenbugs produced a maximum average of 3.3 more nymphs per day at warmer than cooler temperature regimes. Average total fecundity was greatest at 10-23 degrees C, with fewest nymphs being produced at 22-35 degrees C.

Population fluctuations were analysed with respect to environmental factors including air temperature, relative humidity and rainfall in relation to different mango cultivars. Mangoes were sampled every two weeks during the two crop years, to assess the damage Caused by these quarantine pests on ten main cultivars. Three native species of Ceratitis and a recently described new exotic species, Bactrocero invadens made up the complex of economically significant fruit flies associated with the mango tree in Borgou. Ceratitis species Occurred during the dry season and the main species, Ceratitis cosyra, reached a peak at the end of the dry season. B. invadens Populations were scarce during the dry season, but increased steadily from the end of April to reach a peak at the end of June during the rainy season. Regression analyses indicated that minimum-maximum temperature, relative humidity and rainfall Were the Major climatic factors influencing fly populations. Daily rainfall was the factor showing the strongest positive correlation with B. invadens populations. Host plant was another essential factor influencing the population fluctuations. Trapping and rearing data indicated that Ceratitis quinaria and Ceratitis silvestrii, were abundant only in the dry Season, Causing damage only to early cultivars. C. cosyra, also common during the dry season, attacked both early cultivars or mid season cultivars. A consistent population increase of B. invadens in the early rainy season caused considerable damage to mid season and late cultivars. The seasonal increase of the B. invadens population coincided with the fruiting period of the main mango cultivars in this Northern Guinean savannah, but mango availability influenced the population of this new invasive species only when the rains had arrived.

The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L., can be a serious pest of canola as well as of other Brassica crops in this region. However, the ability of P. xylostella to overwinter in southeastern Australia, as well as in other temperate regions of the world, remains controversial. Laboratory experiments indicated that after 60 d in a temperature regimen alternating between 0 and 5 degrees C, 32% of third- and fourth-instar larvae pupated, 38% remained as larvae, and 57% of pupae survived, whereas only 15-20% of adult moths were still alive. Second-, third-, and fourth-instar larvae and pupae survived -5 degrees C for up to 2,4, 6, and 13 d, respectively, with some adults surviving >20 d. Furthermore, adults that survived 60 d of exposure to 0-5 degrees C and 20 d at -5 degrees C reproduced normally without supplemental food. An experiment simulating outdoor overwintering with caged populations and field survey for natural overwintering populations of P. xylostella on volunteer canola (Brassica napus L.) and wild turnip (Rapistrum rugosum L.) plants indicated that development and reproduction continued on these host plants through the winter months.

Glassy-winged sharpshooter population densities and activity were monitored weekly by a combination of visual inspections, beat net sampling, and trapping. Glassy-winged sharpshooter populations were negatively affected by severe plant water stress; however, population densities were not linearly related to decreasing water availability in plants. Citrus trees irrigated at 60% ETc had significantly warmer leaves, lower xylem water potential, and consequently hosted fewer glassy-winged sharpshooter eggs, nymphs, and adults than trees irrigated at 80% ETc. Citrus trees irrigated at 100% ETc hosted similar numbers of glassy-winged sharpshooter stages as trees irrigated at 60% ETc and a lower number of glassy-winged sharpshooter nymphs than the 80% ETc treatment, specifically during the nymphal density peak in mid-April to early July.

If these forecasts are realized, cropping systems are likely to experience significant geographic range transformations among damaging endemic weed species and new vulnerabilities to exotic weed invasions. To anticipate these changes and to devise management strategies for proactively addressing them, it is necessary to characterize the environmental conditions that make specific weed species abundant, competitive, and therefore damaging the production of particular crops (i.e. defining the damage niche). In this study, U.S. maize is used as a model system to explore the implications of climate change on the distribution of damaging agricultural weeds. To accomplish this, we couple ensemble climate change projections of annual temperature and precipitation with survey data of troublesome weed species in maize. At the state scale, space-for-time substitution techniques are used to suggest the potential magnitude of change among damaging weed communities. To explore how the geography of damage for specific species may evolve over the next century, bioclimatic range rules were derived for two weed species that are pervasive in the Northern (Abutilon theophrasti Medicus, ABUTH) and Southern (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers., SORHA) U.S. Results from both analyses suggest that the composition of damaging weed communities may be fundamentally altered by climate change. In some states, potential changes in the coming decades are commensurate to those possible by the end of the century. Regions such as the Northeastern U.S. may prove particularly vulnerable with emerging climate conditions favoring few weed species of present-day significance. In contrast, regions like the mid-South are likely to experience fewer shifts even with a similar magnitude in climate change. By the end of the century in the U.S. Corn Belt, cold-tolerant species likeA. theophrasti may be of minor importance whereas S. halepense, a predominantly Southern U.S. weed species at present, may become common and damaging to maize production with its damage niche advancing 200-600 km north of its present-day distribution.

It has been introduced to North America where it has often established dense stands in both secondary woodlands and relatively undisturbed mature woodlands. In Europe A. platanoides is also extending its original range, but generally seems to exist at much lower densities. One explanation for the 'aggressiveness' of invasive plants such as A. platanoides is that they have left behind pests and diseases which limit their population densities in their native lands (the enemy release hypothesis or ERH). To assess the ERH for Norway maple, a large network of collaborators assessed leaf herbivory rates in populations throughout Europe and North America. We found significantly lower total leaf herbivory (1.6% +/- A 0.19, n = 21 vs. 7.4% +/- A 1.94, n = 34) and lower fungal damage (1.0% +/- A 0.35, n = 13 vs. 3.7% +/- A 0.85, n = 34) in North America than in Europe over a 2 year period, which is consistent with the predictions of the Enemy Release Hypothesis. Across years, the average total leaf herbivory was significantly correlated with average annual temperature of the site (P < 0.05), although this was mostly due to sites in Europe (P < 0.001), and not sites in North America (P > 0.05). Furthermore, only populations in Europe showed very high levels of herbivory (e.g., nine sites had total leaf herbivory ranging from 10.0 to 51.2% in at least 1 year) or leaf fungal damage (only one site in North America showed high levels of fungal damage in 1 year), suggesting the possibility of more frequent episodic outbreaks in the native range. Leaf herbivory and fungal damage are only two aspects of consumer pressure and we do not know whether the differences reported here are enough to actually elicit release from top-down population control, but such large scale biogeographic differences in herbivory contribute towards understanding exotic invasions.",yes,field,damage,,,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1387-3547,1573-1464,2009,10.1007/s10530-008-9312-4,WOS:000263785700021

Smith) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), defoliate and contaminate blueberries, Vaccinium corymbosum L., in eastern North America, but infestations are often not detected until economic damage has been caused. To improve monitoring techniques and understand the phenology of the whitemarked tussock moth in blueberry, we compared four trap types and determined temperature-based phenology of this pest over two growing seasons. Large delta traps captured the greatest number of male moths, and similar moth captures were found with or without monthly lure changing. Traps placed at field perimeters adjacent to woods trapped significantly more moths than those inside fields, whereas position in the canopy (high versus low) did not affect captures. Under laboratory conditions, the lower developmental threshold for larvae was 12.3 degrees C, in close agreement with field studies indicating a 12.8 degrees C threshold. Using the 12.8 degrees C threshold, monitoring of O. leucostigma cohorts on caged blueberry plants revealed a spring generation with egg batch starting at 206 +/- 3 growing degree-days (GDD) and a late-summer generation with egg hatch starting at 1,157 +/- 52 GDD.

Yet the ecological effects of low-frequency climate variations remain largely unknown. Recent analyses of interdecadal variability in population abundance of the Oriental migratory locust (Locusta migratoria manilensis) in China have revealed negative associations with temperature and positive associations with Yangtze drought and flood frequencies during the past millennium (AD 957-1956). In order to shed new light on the causal relationships between locust abundance, floods, droughts and temperature in ancient China, we used wavelet analysis to explore how the coherencies between the different variables at different frequencies have been changed during the past millennium. We find consistent in-phase coherencies between locusts and drought/flood frequencies, and out-of-phase coherencies between locusts and temperature and between drought/flood and temperature at period components of 160-170 years. Similar results are obtained when historical data of drought/flood frequencies of the Yangtze Delta region are used, despite flood data showing a weak and somewhat inconsistent association with other factors. We suggest that previously unreported periodic cooling of 160-170-year intervals dominate climatic variability in China through the past millennium, the cooling events promoting locust plagues by enhancing temperature-associated drought/flood events. Our results signify a rare example of possible benign effects of global warming on the regional risk of natural disasters such as flood/drought events and outbreaks of pest insects.",yes,field,abundance,,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0962-8452,1471-2954,2009,10.1098/rspb.2008.1284,WOS:000262867100005

Indigenous to Southeast Asia, D. pallivitta caterpillars cause defoliation of ornamental nursery stock and pose a human health hazard due to their urticating hairs that can cause painful skin reactions. Identification of the pheromone component n-butyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate (E7,9-10:COOnBu) from D. pallivitta has made it possible to investigate the phenology and population dynamics using baited traps. Male captures in Jackson traps baited with E7,9-10:COOnBu showed a vegetation preference for tall-grass fields and forest/grass interfaces over forest areas. Microlocation preferences were also found for trap height, with over 65% of males being caught in traps suspended at 1 m, compared with the traps at 3 and 5 m. Captures of male moths in traps baited with live females, and direct observations of female calling behavior, showed peak activities 6-7 h after the onset of scotophase. This is a much later communication period than for D. bradleyi and D. trima and may provide a mechanism by which D. pallivitta maintains reproductive isolation in areas where all three species are present. Coastal and inland transects established in eastern Hawai'i measured aspects of population fluctuations and radiation into new areas with relation to elevation and microclimate. Population expansion was measured by comparing moth population means and 80% population boundaries over time. Both population measures showed a higher expansion for the coastal transect. Differences in population expansion may be attributed in part to temperature and elevation, while precipitation does not seem to have a strong effect.

For the study of population fluctuation and the evolution of damage from the psillid we analyzed 20 plants of the orchard biweekly, during the period from March 2005 to June 2006. For each plant we evaluated 10 leaves containing the symptom of the attack from the psillid. The evaluated parameters were the number of nymphs and the percentage of damage caused in the leaves, in accordance with a scale of notes. These parameters were analyzed in histograms and correlated to the meteorological factors. The population density of the psillid increased considerably with the approach of the spring and presented a positive correlation with the temperature. The level of damage of the psillid accompanied the population density of the pest.

Certain biological attributes of this insect predispose it to be a direct post across a wide range of crops. In addition to the direct damage it can cause, this species is an efficient vector of Tomato spotted wilt virus and other Tospoviruses. This review addresses questions regarding the biological and ecological attributes of western flower thrips that have enabled it to become a significant pest and make it so difficult to manage. These important life history traits include western flower thrips polyphagy and a tendency to reside and feed in concealed areas of flowers and fruits. Consequently, large populations can develop and disperse into a wide range of crops. The larvae and adults feed in a similar manner and can share the same host plant resources. The relatively short generation time and haplodiploid sex determination also contribute to the pest status of this species.

To better understand the dynamics of aphid species that occur as pests in cereals, we investigated the relative influence of top-down control by a predator and weather (temperature and precipitation) on population fluctuations of three cereal aphid species. 2 From 1987 to 2005, populations of Metopolophium dirhodum, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi in insecticide-free stands of winter wheat were monitored in the Praha-RuzynE region of the Czech Republic. Densities of an aphidophagous predator, the ladybeetle Coccinella septempunctata, were recorded from an overwintering site in the landscape. Weather was quantified using historical records. 3 A significant bottom-up effect of densities of aphids on those of C. septempunctata was found, but evidence of direct top-down regulation of aphids by C. septempunctata was only significant in the case of R. padi. There was no significant periodicity in the dynamics of the aphid or C. septempunctata, suggesting that there was no clear predator-prey cycle. Combinations of C. septempunctata and weather variables could be used to explain M. dirhodum and R. padi per capita rate of change. There were also indications that weather directly affected peak density of M. dirhodum. 4 We conclude that regional estimates of C. septempunctata densities are not sufficient to determine whether aphid population dynamics are driven by predator-prey interactions.

Copitarsia spp. are not known to occur in the United States but are routinely intercepted at ports of entry. Chronological age survival curves differ significantly among temperatures. Survivorship at early age after hatch is greatest at lower temperatures and declines as temperature increases. Mean longevity was 220 (+/- 13 SEM) days at 9.7 degrees C. Physiological age survival curves constructed with developmental base temperature (7.2 degrees C) did not correspond to those constructed with a senescence base temperature (5.9 degrees C).

In this study, a model describing the temperature-dependent thresholds for swarming activity and temperature requirement for development from egg to adult was driven by transient regional climate scenario data for Sweden, covering the period of 1961-2100 for three future climate change scenarios (SRES A2, A1B and B2). During the 20th century, the weather supported the production of one bark beetle generation per year, except in the north-western mountainous parts of Sweden where the climate conditions were too harsh. A warmer climate may sustain a viable population also in the mountainous part; however, the distributional range of I. typographus may be restricted by the migration speed of Norway spruce. Modelling suggests that an earlier timing of spring swarming and fulfilled development of the first generation will significantly increase the frequency of summer swarming. Model calculations suggest that the spruce bark beetle will be able to initiate a second generation in South Sweden during 50% of the years around the mid century. By the end of the century, when temperatures during the bark beetle activity period are projected to have increased by 2.4-3.8 degrees C, a second generation will be initiated in South Sweden in 63-81% of the years. The corresponding figures are 16-33% for Mid Sweden, and 1-6% for North Sweden. During the next decades, one to two generations per year are predicted in response to temperature, and the northern distribution limit for the second generation will vary.

B,"Mo, J; Stevens, M; Liu, DL",A temperature-driven daily process model for onion thrips populations in onions,"A temperature-driven process model was developed to describe the seasonal patterns of populations of onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman, in onion crops. The model used daily cohorts (individuals of the same developmental stage and daily age) as the population unit. After each day, individuals in a daily cohort either move to the next daily cohort in the same developmental stage, advance to the first daily cohort of the next developmental stage, or be removed from the population due to mortality and/or emigration. Stage transitions were modelled as a logistic function of accumulated degree-days (DD) to account for variability in development rate among individuals. Daily survival was modelled as a logistic function of daily mean temperature. Parameters for development, survival, and fecundity were estimated with published data. A single invasion event was used to initiate the population process, starting at 1-100 days after onion emergence (DAE) for 10-100 days at a daily rate of 0.001-0.9 adults/plant/day. The model was validated against five observed seasonal patterns of onion thrips populations from two unsprayed sites in the Riverina, New South Wales, Australia, during 2003-2006. Performance of the model was measured by a fit index based on the proportion of variation in observed data explained by the model (R-2) and the differences in total thrips-days between observed and predicted populations. Satisfactory agreement between simulated and observed seasonal patterns was obtained within the range of invasion parameters tested. Model best-fit was obtained at invasion starting dates of 6-98 DAE with a daily invasion rate of 0.002-0.2 adults/plant/day and a duration of 30-100 days. Under the best-fit invasion scenarios, the model closely reproduced the observed seasonal patterns, explaining 73-95% of variability in adult and larval densities during population increase periods. The results showed that small invasions of adult thrips over a period of days with a gradual population build-up of thrips within onion crops were sufficient to bring about the observed seasonal patterns of onion thrips populations. Sudden mass invasions may reproduce well the rapid ascending phases of the population build-up but these alone would fail to account for the low population periods. Support for small gradual invasions was found in sticky traps data, which showed that onion thrips were moving into the onion field in small numbers long before the first thrips were detected in onion, and in egg monitoring data, which revealed onion thrips eggs in newly emerged onion leaves. According to the model, applications of contact insecticides are better timed before the accumulated adult populations have reached 10% of total adult thrips-days during seasons of early to intermediate invasions (160 days after onion emergence), and when accumulated adult populations are between 10% and 50% during seasons of late invasions (> 60 days after onion emergence). Model simulations also suggest that management practices that delay or reduce onion thrips invasions are critical in controlling peak infestation levels. Such practices include removal of volunteer onions (sprouts from left-over bulbs from previous seasons) and weed control, which reduce the source populations, and the application of a systemic insecticide at sowing, which protect onion plants from onion thrips infestation during the early growth stages. Temperature driven, the model can be directly used to assess the impact of climate change on onion thrips populations. After modifications of species-specific parameters, the model can be easily adapted to describe the population dynamics of other insect species.",no,,,,,18TH WORLD IMACS CONGRESS AND MODSIM09 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: INTERFACING MODELLING AND SIMULATION WITH MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES,NA,NA,IMACS World Congress/Modelling and Simulation Society-of-Australia-and-New-Zealand (MSSANZ)/18th MODSIM09 Biennial Conference on Modelling and Simulation,"JUL 13-17, 2009","Cairns, AUSTRALIA","IMACS, MSSANZ, CSIRO, Australian Math Sci Inst, Griffith Univ, eWater Cooperat Res Ctr, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, HEMA Consulting, Hellenic European Res Comp Math & Applicat, Int Council Ind Appl Math, Int Soc Grid Generat (ISGG), Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing (ISPRS), Japan Soc Simulat Technol, Pacific Rim Math Assoc, Rutgers, State Univ New Jersey",NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,2009,NA,WOS:000290045000081

B,"Nador, G; Fenyes, D; Surek, G; Vasas, L",Monitoring of maize damage caused by western corn rootworm by remote sensing,"As one of the consequences of global warming, the gradual dispersion of western corn rootworm (WCR) is becoming a serious maize pest in Europe and all over the world. The WCR was introduced to Europe from the USA. First it was detected in Europe near Beograd in 1992. The WCR has spread from its initial infestation point to a range of several hundred kilometres, affecting many countries in the region including Hungary first in 1995. The structure of a healthy, WCR free maize field shows straight rows in a clear order and upstanding maize stalks. WCR infection can cause wilted broken corn stalks randomly lying on the ground. That means the damage itself causes physical and visible disorder in the maize field. Our goal is to assess and identify the disorders and structural changes caused by WCR using polarimetic radar images (ALOS PALSAR). The initial results of our assessment will be presented in this paper. This project has been implemented in the framework of the tender called by the Ministry of Environment and Water and with the support of the Hungarian Space Office. To develop and extend the method is worthwhile as the WCR monitoring system is expeditious, objective and economical. The development of the system will create the possibility to monitor the spread of WCR on larger areas and to forecast the following year's damage. The amount of information can be used efficiently in plant protection; moreover can be useful for farmers, pesticide producers, state authorities and research institutes.",no,,,,,REMOTE SENSING FOR A CHANGING EUROPE,NA,NA,28th European-Association-of-Remote-Sensing-Laboratories (EARSeL) Symposium and Workshops on Remote Sensing for a Changing Europe,"JUN 02-05, 2008","Istanbul Tech Univ, Remote Sensing Div, ITU Maslak Campus, Istanbul, TURKEY",European Assoc Remote Sensing Labs,"Istanbul Tech Univ, Remote Sensing Div, ITU Maslak Campus",NA,NA,,NA,NA,2009,10.3233/978-1-58603-986-8-255,WOS:000342298700035

This paper describes aspects of the life history of C. lituratus, information required to monitor psyllid populations and develop management strategies. The psyllid has five nymphal instars. Feeding by these nymphs causes considerable damage to the foliage of host trees. The different nymphal instars are distinguishable oil the basis of body and lerp dimensions, colouration and wing bud morphology. Mean fecundity in captive populations was 95 eggs per female (observed range 130-148). Egg and juvenile development had threshold temperatures of 3 degrees and 10 degrees C respectively, and the relationship between development rate and temperature was determined for both stages. Adult longevity was reduced at high temperatures, which affected fecundity and may account for the low psyllid population densities observed in plantations over summer. Parasitism of the nymphal instars by two species of Psyllaephagus wasps was observed. While parasitism may exceed 90% in field surveys it is uncertain what role it plays in regulating Populations.

One such species is the browntail moth Euproctis chrysorrhoea L, which was discovered in the eastern United States in 1897. Its range expanded until 1914; after 1915, howvever, its range contracted and now it persists in only two isolated coastal locations. Although a biological control agent has been implicated in this range collapse, cold inland winter temperatures may also help to restrict browntail moth populations. We surveyed coastal versus inland habitats in Maine and Massachusetts for browntail moth overwintering mortality and larval density per web. We also performed an experiment assessing these same variables in coastal versus inland habitats on different host plant species and at different initial larval densities. We also analyzed temperature records to assess whether winter temperatures correlated with changes in the invasive range. Overwintering mortality was lower in coastal populations for both the experimental populations and in the Maine field survey. Experimental populations in Cape Cod coastal areas also had lower rates of fall mortality and higher larval densities, suggesting that coastal areas are better year-round habitats than inland areas. There were no consistent differences between coastal and inland populations in their response to larval density or host plant although overall survival in both areas was higher at low initial larval densities and affected by host identity. There was also no difference in two measures of the coldest winter temperatures during browntail moth's expansion and contraction.

S. and Mexico and that is currently the object of an eradication/control program in both countries. One tactic used to mitigate the threat of this species involves the SIT (Sterile Insect Technique), in which large numbers of larvae are reared on artificial diet or cactus cladodes, preferably the former, and released as sterile adults to mate with wild individuals at or near the leading edge of invasion. We studied combinations of 3 different rearing temperatures (22, 26, and 29 degrees C) and 3 different crowding levels (50, 215, and 500 eggs) to determine percent survival to the adult stage, pupal size of each gender, and fecundity of C. cactorum reared on a factitious meridic diet. Temperature and crowding levels affected survival. The lowest rearing temperature and the low and high crowding levels adversely affect survival. Female pupae were larger than male pupae, and pupal size of males, but not females, was affected by rearing temperature, with smaller male pupae produced at the lowest temperature. Length and width, but not weight, of female pupae were affected by crowding levels, with slightly larger pupae produced at the intermediate level.

The trapping grid consisted of 700 traps. Throughout the growing season (July-October), McPhail traps loaded with ammonium sulphate were inspected at 5-day intervals. Trapping data were analysed using Getis-Ord local spatial statistics. Clustering of trapped flies was significantly related to elevation, which ranged from sea level to 700 m above sea level. The effect of elevation upon clustering depended on seasonal climatic patterns. During the summer, 'hot-spots' (i.e. significant aggregations of captured insects) were located at intermediate to high elevations and 'cold-spots' (i.e. areas with significantly low numbers of captured insects) were found in the valleys. In contrast, during the fall, 'hot-spots' were detected at lower elevations and 'cold-spots' at higher elevations. Population phenology seemed to affect spatial patterns. During periods of low population levels across the entire region, clusters of traps with relatively high amounts of captured insects were found at lower elevations. Pest management activities may have affected population levels throughout the region, but our data set does not allow quantifying their effectiveness.

The lower aphid death rate at low water levels might be due to the water stress in plants. 4 For 2004 (a year with moderate precipitation), the Nitrogen main effect was significant for both the birth and death rates.

Abundance of A. transitella was compared between these crops by examining total and infested mummy nuts collected in trees and on the ground between January and March in 2003 and 2004, and by examining the number of males captured in sticky traps baited with virgin females as a pheromone source during the subsequent growing seasons. There was an 8-9-fold greater density of total mummies (potential hosts) in pistachios compared to almonds. The proportion of mummies infested was not significantly different between the crops in 2003, but significantly more almond than pistachio mummies were infested in 2004. In 2003, the average density of infested mummies per hectare was greater in pistachios than in almonds, but in 2004 the converse was true.

The model uses a modified Gompertz equation, y = 96.5 x exp(-(exp(6.0 - 0.00404 x (x - 4.0)))), where x is cumulative heat (degree-days), to predict y, cumulative proportional emergence expressed as a percentage. The model starts degree-day accumulation on the date of corn, Zea maps L., emergence, and predictions correspond closely to corn phenological stages from tasseling to black layer development. Validation shows the model predicts cumulative proportional adult emergence within a satisfactory interval of 4.5 d.

The first major outbreak in Saskatchewan was recorded in 1983. In 1984, Saskatchewan wheat midge populations were found to be parasitized by the egg parasitoid, Macroglenes penetrans (Kirby) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). This paper describes the effect of temperature on diapause termination, larval and pupal development, and on emergence of field populations of adult wheat midge, S. mosellana, and its parasitoid, M. penetrans, in Saskatchewan. Wheat midge and parasitoid populations were investigated from 1984 to 1985 ill five wheat fields where wheat midge populations ranged from 5256 to 43,798 larvae/m(2). The appearance of midge larvae in soil samples on May 14 and May 9 in 1984 and 1985, respectively, marked the end of overwintering diapause. Pupae first appeared in samples on June 15 (139 degree-days (DID); > 6 degrees C) and June 10 (125 DD) in 1984 and 1985, respectively. Adult midge and parasitoids began to emerge at all locations on July 6 (411 DD; > 6 degrees C) and on July 9 (447 DD) in 1984 and 1985, respectively. In relation to the pest-host plant synchrony, adults of both wheat midge and parasitoids were present throughout July, with peak midge emergence coinciding both years with the emergence of primary wheat heads from the boot. We observed the first primary heads from about July 12 to 15 at the five sites. Therefore, the relatively long wheat midge emergence has significance because it contributes to damage on the first and second tillers and to a possible increase in populations for the following year. The use of temperature and day-degree accumulation in relation to development is discussed as a predictive tool for management decisions. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Webber, J; Chapman, RB; Worner, SP",Forecasting emergence and movement of overwintering hazelnut big bud mites from big buds,"Eriophyoid big bud mites are key pests of hazelnut throughout the world, but they are difficult to control with chemicals or other methods because they are protected inside the bud. The most effective time for control is during the relatively short emergence period which is difficult for growers to predict. The key objectives of this study were to monitor mite emergence from big buds in spring, determine the phenology of mites in relation to tree phenology and weather, and identify the optimum timing for control measures. Mite emergence was found to occur between early and late spring in Canterbury, New Zealand. Mite emergence and movement occurred when daily maximum temperatures were > 15 degrees C and when mean temperatures were > 9 degrees C, with mite emergence increasing with temperature. The developmental status of new buds during mite emergence was a crucial factor in the infestation of new buds. An accumulated heat sum model (DD), starting at Julian date 152 and using a lower threshold temperature of 6 degrees C, predicted the onset of emergence on two cultivars and at two sites at approximately 172 DD. A regression model based on leaf number, bud length, bud width, DD and Julian date provided a more satisfactory prediction of percent accumulated mite emergence. It is recommended both peak mite emergence and the developmental status of hazelnut buds be used to optimise the time to apply control measures. The optimum time to apply a control was predicted to be before buds measure 0.5 x 0.5 mm (width x length), are enclosed within the axil, and have a rounded tip, or, when 50% accumulated mite emergence has occurred, whichever occurs first.",no,,,,,EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0168-8162,1572-9702,2008,10.1007/s10493-008-9163-9,WOS:000258883400004

Insect-resistant transgenic plants invest some nutrients to the production of specific toxic proteins [i.e. endotoxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)], which could alter the C-N balance of these plants, especially under changed abiotic conditions. Aphids are nonsusceptible to Lepidoptera-targeted Bt Cry1Ac toxin and they typically show response to abiotic conditions, and here we sought to discover whether they might perform differently on compositionally changed Bt oilseed rape. Bt oilseed rape had increased N content in the leaves coupled with reduced total C compared with its nontransgenic counterpart, but in general the C : N responses of both plant types to elevated CO2 and temperature were similar. Elevated CO2 decreased N content and increased C : N ratio of both plant types. Elevated temperature increased C and N contents, total chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations under ambient CO2, but decreased these under elevated CO2. In addition, soluble sugars were increased and starch decreased by elevated temperature under ambient but not under elevated CO2, whereas photosynthesis was decreased in plants grown under elevated temperature in both CO2 levels. Myzus persicae, a generalist aphid species, responded directly to elevated temperature with reduced developmental time and decreased adult and progeny weights, whereas the development of the Brassica specialist Brevicoryne brassicae was less affected. Feeding by M. persicae resulted in an increase in the N content of oilseed rape leaves under ambient CO2, indicating the potential of herbivore feeding itself to cause allocation changes. The aphids performed equally well on both plant types despite the differences between C-N ratios of Bt and non-Bt oilseed rape, revealing the absence of plant composition-related effects on these pests under elevated CO2, elevated temperature or combined elevated CO2 and temperature conditions.",yes,experimental,laboratory,consumption,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,1365-2486,2008,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01574.x,WOS:000255707200018

Its broad host range of at least 20 eucalypt species and wide geographical distribution provides it the potential to become a serious forestry pest both within Australia and, if accidentally introduced, overseas. Although populations of A atomaria are genetically similar throughout its range, population dynamics differ between regions. Here, we determine temperature-dependent developmental requirements using beetles sourced from temperate and subtropical zones by calculating lower temperature thresholds, temperature-induced mortality, and day-degree requirements. We combine these data with field mortality estimates of immature life stages to produce a cohort-based model, ParopSys, using DYMEX(TM) that accurately predicts the timing, duration, and relative abundance of life stages in the field and number of generations in a spring-autumn (September-May) field season. Voltinism was identified as a seasonally plastic trait dependent upon environmental conditions, with two generations observed and predicted in the Australian Capital Territory, and up to four in Queensland. Lower temperature thresholds for development ranged between 4 and 9 degrees C, and overall development rates did not differ according to beetle origin. Total immature development time (egg-adult) was approximately 769.2 +/- S.E. 127.8 DD above a lower temperature threshold of 6.4 +/- S.E. 2.6 degrees C. ParopSys provides a basic tool enabling forest managers to use the number of generations and seasonal fluctuations in abundance of damaging life stages to estimate the pest risk of P. atomaria prior to plantation establishment, and predict the occurrence and duration of damaging life stages in the field. Additionally, by using local climatic data the pest potential of P. atomaria can be estimated to predict the risk of it establishing if accidentally introduced overseas.

The existence of genetic variation indicates a species' potential to respond to new environmental conditions, thus facilitating its success as an invader. Accordingly, evolutionary and ecological approaches are needed to identify the factors explaining both species' range and their potential to invade new areas. We combined these two approaches and studied whether genetic variation in life-history traits under abiotic (temperature) and biotic (host plant) selection pressures contributes to the potential range expansion of Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We reared full-sib families of L. decemlineata from the current northernmost European population at 15 degrees C (temperature below that in the current range) and 25 degrees C (optimal temperature) and on three potato varieties. We monitored development time, adult weight and larval-to-adult survival, and estimated the amount of heritable variance. The development time and adult weight of progenies were more variable between than within families. Thus, there was genetic variability in traits relevant to the ability to adapt to a colder environment (i.e., accelerate development and become heavier) allowing range expansion further north in Europe, even though low temperature increased beetle mortality. Temperature strongly affected all traits measured. Potato variety, in turn, did not strongly affect beetles' performance. Beetle ability to adapt to a cool environment was further enhanced by the fact that size was not constrained by fast development. The results showed that beetle populations possess genetic variation allowing a response to temperature and thus have the evolutionary potential to adapt and spread beyond their current range.",no,,,,,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0013-8703,1570-7458,2008,10.1111/j.1570-7458.2008.00685.x,WOS:000255060200009

All populations in Japan were bivoltine until the early 1970s, at which time trivoltine populations appeared in several southern regions. Presently, H. cunea exists as separate bivoltine and trivoltine populations divided around latitude 36 degrees. In the course of this voltinism change, the mean surface temperature in Japan rose by 1.0 degrees C. To determine whether and how this temperature increase might be responsible for the voltinism change, we constructed an age-structured model incorporating growth speed driven by actual daily temperature and detailed mechanisms of diapause induction triggered by both daily photoperiod and temperature. The simulation result suggests that both the acceleration of the growth speed and the prolongation of diapause induction are necessary to cause changes in voltinism, regardless of temperature increase. We concluded that the H. cunea population changed its life-history traits as an adaptation parallel with its invasion into the south-western parts of Japan.

In addition, total N pools and resin bag capture of NH4 and NO3 were significantly higher in infested versus uninfested forests throughout this study. Increases in N were likely due to a combination of factors including enhanced decomposition, reduced uptake of water and N by declining trees, sparse understory vegetation, and N-enriched throughfall from infested canopies.

More than 200 trees of different levels of crown transparency (needle loss) were felled between 2001 and 2005 and sections of them incubated in insect emergence traps. Colonisation densities were related to the transparency level of each host tree at the time of attack. 3. Trees with more than 80% needle loss were colonised most frequently, but the breeding density was highest in trees with 65-80% needle loss. 4. The scolytine Ips acuminatus and the buprestid Phaenops cyanea colonised trees with 30-90% needle loss in high densities. The bark beetle Tomicus minor was less aggressive, preferring trees with 60-85% needle loss. The hymenopteran Sirex noctilio and the cerambycid Acanthocinus aedilis were restricted to greatly weakened trees with 50-85% needle loss. Most species colonised trees that had experienced a decline in vigour, that is an increase in crown transparency shortly before attack. 5. The infestation dynamics of P. cyanea covaried with the drought index as well as with temperature. 6.

The soybean aphid has spread rapidly within North America, presumably through a combination of active and passive (wind-aided) flight. Here, we studied the active flight potential of A. glycines under a range of environmental conditions using an aphid flight mill. Winged (alate) A. glycines were tested on a specially designed 32-channel, computer-monitored flight mill system. Aphids that were 12-24 h old exhibited the strongest flight behavior, with average flight durations of 3.3-4.1 h, which represented flight distances of 4.6-5.1 km. After the age of 72 h, A. glycines flight performance rapidly declined. The optimum temperature range for flight was 16-28 degrees C, whereas optimum relative humidity was 75%. Our findings show that A. glycines posseses a fairly strong active flight aptitude (ability and inclination) and point to the possibility of flight initiation under abroad range of environmental conditions.

To analyze this complexity requires the development of models that include not only the effects of biotic factors on species dynamics and interactions, but also the effects of abiotic factors including weather. The need for such capacity has appreciably increased as we face the threat of global climate change. In this paper, bi- and tri-trophic physiologically based demographic models of alfalfa, cotton, grape, olive and the noxious weed yellow starthistle systems are used to explore some of the potential effects of climate change. A general model that applies to all species in all trophic levels (including the economic one) is used to simulate the effects of observed and projected weather on system dynamics. Observed daily weather and that of climate model scenarios were used as forcing variables in our studies. Geographic information system (GRASS GIS) is used to map the predicted effects on species across the varied ecological zones of California. The predictions of the geographic distribution and abundance of the various species examined accords well with field observations. Furthermore, the models predict how the geographic range and abundance of the some species would be affected by climate change. Among the findings are: (1) The geographic range of tree species such as olive that require chilling to break dormancy (i.e. vernalization) may be limited in some areas due to climate warming, but their range may expand in others. For example, olive phenology and yield will be affected in the southern part of California due to high temperature, but may expand in northern areas until limited by low winter temperatures. Pest distribution and abundance will also be affected. For example, climate warming would allow the cold intolerant pink bollworm in cotton to expand its range into formerly inhospitable heavy frost areas of the San Joaquin Valley, and damage rates will increase throughout its current range. The distribution and abundance of other cold intolerant pests such as olive fly, the Mediterranean fruit fly and others could be similarly affected. In addition, species dominance and existence in food webs could change (e.g. in alfalfa), and the biological control of invasive species might be adversely affected (e.g. vine mealybug in grape). The distribution and abundance of invasive weeds such as yellow starthistle will be altered, and its control by extant and new biological control agents will be difficult to predict because climate change will differentially affects each. (2) Marginal analysis of multiple regression models of the simulation data provides a useful way of analyzing the efficacy of biological control agents. Models could be useful as guides in future biological control efforts on extant and new exotic pest species. (3) Major deficiencies in our capacity to predict the effects of climate change on biological interactions were identified: (1) There is need to improve existing models to better forecast the effects of climate change on crop system components; (2) The current system for collecting daily weather data consists of a patchwork of station of varying reliability that often record different variables and in different units. Especially vexing, is the dearth of solar radiation data at many locations.

However, whether climate change also influences the eruptive dynamics of forest pest insects, and hence the ecological and economical consequences of outbreaks, is largely unresolved. 2. Using historical outbreak records covering more than a century, we document recent outbreak range expansions of two species of cyclic geometrid moth, Operophtera brumata Bkh.

The two species differ with respect to cold tolerance, and show strikingly different patterns in their recent outbreak range expansion. 3. We show that, during the past 15-20 years, the less cold-tolerant species O. brumata has experienced a pronounced north-eastern expansion into areas previously dominated by E. autumnata outbreaks. Epirrita autumnata, on the other hand, has expanded the region in which it exhibits regular outbreaks into the coldest, most continental areas. Our findings support the suggestion that recent climate warming in the region is the most parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns. 4.

This study investigated the effect of varying day-lengths (9, 11, 13 and 16 h) at 26 degrees C as well as constant (18, 22, 26 and 30 degrees C) and fluctuating (10/22 degrees C) temperatures on biological characteristics of Orius niger (Wolff). Photoperiod did not induce reproductive diapause and did not significantly affect development, survival of eggs and nymphs, longevity, fecundity or sex ratio; with the exception of the 16 h day-length which led to a shorter duration of nymphal development. Fluctuating temperatures and a constant temperature of 18 degrees C increased the incubation period, duration of nymphal development, total developmental time, generation time and longevity, compared to the constant temperatures of 22, 26 and 30 degrees C, but decreased fecundity compared to 22 and 26 degrees C. On the other hand, sex ratio was not influenced by 10/22 and 18 degrees C. Egg hatch rate and nymph survival differed significantly between temperature regimes, being lower at 18 and 10/22 degrees C. These results suggest that O. niger would be able to survive and reproduce under winter conditions in unheated Mediterranean greenhouses and is a candidate for use in the biological control of pests.",yes,experimental,laboratory,fecundity,,BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0958-3157,1360-0478,2008,10.1080/09583150802302215,WOS:000259622100002

For this reason, knowledge of the thermal developmental constants, the determination of the degree day accumulation (DD) necessary for each stage of development and each generation and the role of the biotic factors in the dynamics of populations of this pest are of special importance. The development of P. corylifoliella Hb. occurs according to the formula of Savescu (1965). Thus, the threshold value is T-0=6 degrees C, the thermal constant K=630 degrees C, the prolificacy threshold value O=11 degrees C, the optimum thermal O-1=28,3 degrees C and the upper threshold T=31.1 degrees C. Of practical interest for the control of this pest are the degree day (DD) accumulated to the start of adult flights, the maximum of the flight curve and egg laying period. The medium values of these were: 21.5 degrees C and 157.3 degrees C for the overwintered generation (the 3(rd) generation), 423.7 degrees C, 807.9 degrees C and 37.71C for the 1(st) generation, 979.2 degrees C, 1790.6 degrees C and 46.9 degrees C for the 2(nd) generation.

In spite of its pest status, many aspects of the ecology of this insect in macadamia orchards are poorly understood. This study analyzes long-term N. viridula damage to macadamia nuts and investigates the extent to which damage to nuts occurs in the tree canopy, prior to nut-drop. We show that there are distinct seasonal peaks in damage detected after harvest and that, over six years of data collection, mean damage levels were fairly low, albeit with spikes in damage levels recorded. Sampling nuts at peak harvest periods from different strata in the trees and from the ground showed that incidence of damaged nuts within the canopy was typically half as high as on the fallen nuts. Damage to fallen nuts may have occurred prior to nut-drop, and continued to accumulate after nut-drop. These results show that management of N. viridula within macadamia canopies, as opposed to only on fallen nuts, is important. A sampling procedure and predictive model for estimating late-season damage based on early-season damage samples is provided. The model uses January and March damage measurements (based on samples with set level of accuracy), mean temperature and month of the year for which damage is predicted.

A study was initiated to see how population growth of a E occidentalis population on greenhouse grown chrysanthemum was affected by flower growth and development. The hypothesis was that the relative reproduction rate of thrips was not constant over time but increased when flowers were available. Plants of the chrysanthemum pot plant cultivar 'Lompoc' were infested with female western flower thrips and grown at three different temperatures. The results showed that thrips growth and development was stimulated by an increased temperature, and that the increase was not correlated with the effect of temperature on chrysanthemum flower development. Since there was no significant difference between thrips grown on plants with or without flowers, the original hypothesis could not be supported.

Citrus limonia (Rangpur lime), Murraya paniculata (orange jessamine) and Citrus sunki (Sunki mandarin) were used as hosts. Measurements included duration and viability of the egg and nymphal stages, sex ratio, fecundity and longevity. In order to verify the effect of temperature on D. citri biology, the duration and viability of its developmental stages and biological cycle were compared at seven different temperature conditions. Durations of the embryonic and nymphal stages were similar for Rangpur lime, orange jessamine and mandarin. However, the nymphal viability obtained on mandarin was lower than the values obtained on the other hosts. Fecundity was higher on orange jessamine and, in all instances, females had greater longevity than males. A fixed number of instars (five) was obtained on the three hosts. Rangpur lime and orange jessamine provided better D. citri development when compared with mandarin. Duration of the egg and nymphal stages varied from 2.6 to 7.7 and from 9.4 to 35.8 days, respectively, at temperatures from 18 to 32 degrees C. Egg viability was higher than 81.6% at the temperature range studied (18-32 degrees C); nymphal viability was higher than 70% at the 18-30 degrees C range, differing from viability at 32 degrees C, which was dramatically reduced.

Based on life table studies, it has been proposed that the growth of aphid populations could be modeled with an exponential growth model, with r decreasing linearly with time. This model has never been tested under field conditions. 2 The soybean aphid Aphis glycines is a new invasive pest to soybean production in the U.S.A. In the present study, we present five datasets on the growth of colonies of A. glycines, monitored during population growth and decline under predator-free conditions in three soybean fields, from 2003 to 2006. 3 We demonstrate that an exponential growth model, with r decreasing linearly with time, gives a much better description of A. glycines dynamics for all datasets (R-2 = 0.94-0.99) than the exponential (R-2 = 0.42-0.98) or logistic growth models (R-2 = 0.77-0.99). Furthermore, it is shown by cross-validation that the exponential model with decreasing r can be used to make population predictions, as shown by the coefficient of prediction, R-pred(2) ranging from 0.55 to 0.97. An improved proved fit of the model was obtained using both aphid (R-pred(2) > 0.79) and soybean pred (R-pred(2) > 0.86) degree-days scales, indicating temperature effects on the phenological time scale for the decrease in r. 4 Our model suggests important bottom-up control of A. glycines population growth, which may interact with other mortality factors.

However, this mite has been found infesting Cabrales cheese in Spain, though its population density is low compared to Acarus farris, the prevalent species of astigmatid mite encountered in Cabrales cheese maturing caves. One of the factors that might be influencing this differential abundance is temperature. In the present study the effect of temperature on reproductive parameters and longevity of T. neiswanderi was examined at six constant temperatures, ranging from 10 to 31 degrees C, and a relative humidity of 90 +/- 5%. Preoviposition period, fecundity and daily fecundity were adversely affected by extreme temperatures while the oviposition period increased as temperature was reduced. Male and female longevity increased as temperature decreased, but males showed significantly greater longevity than females. Additionally, this difference was greater as temperature decreased. The effect of temperature on the intrinsic rate of natural increase of T. neiswanderi populations was described by the non-linear Lactin model. The optimum temperature for development was predicted at 26.6 degrees C. At this temperature, the population doubling time is 2.8 days. The lower and upper thresholds for T. neiswanderi populations were calculated at 7.4 and 31.7 degrees C, respectively.

This study investigates changes in the climatic niche of one of the most important agricultural pests, the European Corn Borer (Ostrinia nubilalis, Hubner), using the multi-generational phenology model ECAMON. The model enables us to predict the development of the European Corn Borer (ECB), to estimate the risk of its establishing a permanent population, and to give an indication of climate-related stress factors affecting the species. The evaluation of ECAMON demonstrated that it provides accurate predictions of the onset and duration of the key phenological stages over a broad range of sites. It explains over 70% of the variation in the timing of key developmental stages based only on daily weather data. ECAMON simulations correctly predicted the presence/absence of the ECB over the study region during the 1961-1990 reference period. It also helped to explain the sudden increase in the maize infestation over the territory of the Czech Republic during the unusually warm period of 1991-2000. The ECAMON results demonstrated that the effect of climate will be significant and complex. According to our estimates, the extent of the climate niche will expand within the next 20-30 years to cover almost the entire area suitable for agriculture by 2040-2075. The establishment of a bivoltine population is not imminent within the next decade, but it is likely to take place during the period of 2025-2050. The timing and extent of these changes will be affected not only by changes in the means of key meteorological parameters, but also in their variability. These shifts will be clearly accompanied by an earlier onset of key developmental stages of the pest. The study demonstrated that the level of uncertainty caused both by emission scenarios and by differences in global circulation models (GCMs) are of the same order of magnitude. Thus, only the combination of a wide range of emission scenarios and GCMs can provide insight into the potential effect of climate change on any particular species. Under future climate conditions, grain maize is expected to partly replace traditional cereals (e.g. winter wheat, rye, etc.); thus the establishment of a national or international monitoring scheme is desirable, and an ECAMON-like tool might serve as the basic modeling platform for such an effort.

J,"Bommarco, R; Wetterlind, S; Sigvald, R",Cereal aphid populations in non-crop habitats show strong density dependence,"1. Few studies have addressed how density-dependent and density-independent regulation of population growth and abundance varies among habitats for a species that requires multiple habitat types to complete its life cycle. Understanding such relationships, however, are of direct relevance to the control of crop pest insects that regularly move between crop and non-crop habitats. 2. We used autoregressive models to analyse a series of seasonal catches of the cereal aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. The data were collected from regional suction traps and egg counts on the overwintering host, over a period of 14-31 years, at four locations in Sweden. R. padi is an obligate host-alternating species in Sweden and seasonal catches reflect habitat use in a year: the primary woody host in winter and spring, the cereal crops in summer, and the perennial grasslands in the autumn. 3. Strong direct density dependence acting within the year was found, but the strength varied between seasons depending on habitat use by the aphids during the year. Only a weak indication or no indication at all of density dependence was found during the period of residency on the primary host in the winter and spring periods. 4. Density dependence occurred when R. padi utilized summer cereals (42% of the variation was explained), and even stronger density dependence occurred in the perennial grasslands in the autumn (70% variation explained). Stochastic fluctuations in the winter and spring were balanced by a strong density dependence in the cereal and grassland habitats in the summer and autumn periods, which reduced variability in population fluctuations. 5. Weather, measured as seasonal average temperature and accumulated precipitation, did not affect aphid abundance fluctuations much, explaining only 1-9% of the variability. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that density-dependent regulation of R. padi occurs in late summer grasslands and early summer cereals. The mechanisms causing these patterns are not understood, making it difficult to provide specific pest management recommendations at this stage. The results do indicate, however, that pest management needs to involve a landscape-level approach, taking into account mechanistic information about the plant, herbivore and predator interactions in multiple habitats visited by the herbivorous pest.",yes,field,abundance,,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0021-8901,1365-2664,2007,10.1046/j.0021-8901.2007.01332.x,WOS:000249425100012

J,"Klass, JI; Blanford, S; Thomas, MB",Development of a model for evaluating the effects of environmental temperature and thermal behaviour on biological control of locusts and grasshoppers using pathogens,"Recent years have seen an upsurge in locust and grasshopper populations in many parts of the world. Environmentally sustainable approaches to locust and grasshopper control may be possible through the use of biopesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi. Unfortunately, the performance of these biopesticides is highly variable with environmental temperature and host thermoregulatory behaviour critically determining the pattern and extent of mortality after applications. Here, we present a temperature-dependent model that enables us to predict the field performance of Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum, the key fungal pathogen used in locust biopesticides. The model was constructed using mortality rate data generated across a range of temperatures in the laboratory and is driven by environmental temperature data linked through host body temperature models. Model predictions were validated against empirical field data obtained for five species, Locustana pardalina, Oedaleus senegalensis, Zonocerus variegatus, Nomadacris septemfasciata and Chortoicetes terminifera. Mortality predictions were accurate to a 2-day error in every 10 days. This level of resolution is satisfactory to guide operational use of the biopesticide. The model was subsequently used for a prospective evaluation of the performance of M. anisopliae var. acridum against two additional pest species, Dociostaurus maroccanus and Calliptamus italicus in Spain. Results suggest that this pathogen would work reasonably well against these species as long as early instars are targeted.

J,"Kiritani, K",The impact of global warming and land-use change on the pest status of rice and fruit bugs (Heteroptera) in Japan,"Infestation by rice and fruit bugs (Heteroptera) became a nationwide problem in Japan in the early 1970s. Nine rice bug species and three fruit bug species have been designated as economically important. Cropping restrictions for rice produced fallow paddy fields where various rice bugs reproduced and became abundant. Plautia crossota stali, Halyomorpha halys and Glaucias subpunctatus are dominant species of fruit bug that cause damage to a range of fruit crops. However, they require cones in order to complete their life cycle. Coniferous trees planted in the 1950s bore cones after 20 years. A dry and hot summer contributes to good masting the following year and good cone production, in turn, contributes to the abundance of fruit bugs in the third year. Thus, there is strong circumstantial evidence that land-use changes were responsible for the abundance of both rice and fruit bugs during the last 30 years. Poleward range expansion was observed in Nezara viridula, Leptocorisa chinensis, G. subpunctatus and Paradasynus spinosus. A survey conducted to assess winter mortality revealed that every 1 degrees C rise in mean winter temperature resulted in a reduction of about 15% in winter mortality of N. viridula and H. halys in localities where the mean winter temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C. In general, species with low developmental zero (T-0) and small thermal constant (K) show the greatest increase in annual number of generations. Species with a high T-0 for preoviposition period show the greatest increase in reproductive activity, while overwintering insects with a lower T-0 tend to appear earlier in response to the elevation of temperature. Numbers of warnings issued by the prefectures on the occurrence of rice bugs and fruit bugs were correlated. Recent global warming operates in various ways, (e.g. by increasing annual number of generations, reproductive activity and food, to produce such correlation). There are no substantial bug problems in Korea where no significant land-use changes have occurred. Rice bug outbreaks in Japan are predicted to become less frequent in the future, because there is no further scope for cropping restriction. Planting of coniferous trees has been continuously decreasing since 1970, but the area of coniferous forest is still almost the same. This suggests that the fruit bug problem will continue for the foreseeable future.",yes,field,abundance,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1354-1013,NA,2007,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01397.x,WOS:000248959400004

Optimum temperature for development was around 30 degrees C for all stages. Temperature fluctuation in cooler High Country areas (above 1400 m) with a mean temperature around 15 degrees C seems to be critical for the development of the pest, which may be responsible for the near absence of pest in those areas. Temperature fluctuations (18-30 degrees C) in the Mid Country region (600-1200 m) favor the development of the pest compared to development under constant conditions.

We examined the impact of naturally occurring predators in the field by using exclusion cages during July-August 2004 and 2005. Field cages of different mesh diameters were used to exclude different sizes of natural enemies from aphid-infested plots. Plots were surveyed twice weekly for A. glycines and natural enemies. Densities were recorded. Cage effects on mean temperature and soybean growth were found to be insignificant. Significant differences in aphid density were found between treatments in both years of the study (2004 and 2005); however, aphid densities between years were highly variable. Orius insidiosus (Say) was the most commonly occurring predator in the field. Other natural enemies were present in both years but not in high numbers. Parasitoids were present in both years, but their numbers did not suppress aphid densities. Treatment differences within years were related to the abundance of natural enemies. The large differences in aphid abundance between years were associated with the higher number of O. insidiosus found in the field in 2005 (416 total O. insidiosus) than in 2004 (149 total O. insidiosus).

Laboratory life history studies were conducted at 18, 22, 26, 30, and 34 degrees C to understand cactus moth biology and to develop strategies for control. Duration of immature stages was generally longest at 18 degrees C, declining significantly at 22 degrees C, and shortest at 26, 30, and 34 degrees C. Total immature developmental time from eggs to pupae was approximate to 180 d at 18 degrees C, 116 at 22 degrees C, and ranged from 65 to 72 d at 26-34 degrees C. Developmental rate for egg-to-pupal stages was estimated using the logistic equation, rate = 0.0165/(1 + (T/20.7093)(-5-8823)). Percentage survival of immatures was usually lowest at the temperature extremes tested (18 and 34 degrees C), but they did not differ between the sexes. Estimated lower developmental threshold temperature was 13.3 degrees C, resulting in estimated degree-days for development from approximate to 845 at 18 degrees C to 1,387 at 34 degrees C. In general, pupal weights declined with increasing temperature, and they were always lower in males than in females. Female adult survivorship was longest at 18 degrees C, and shortest at 34 degrees C, with the other treatments clustered between the temperature extremes.

However, possible global warming may make the insect move to higher latitudes and altitudes, allowing it to attack new pine species. In this respect, the aim of the present article was to assess both the acceptance and performance of T destruens offered host and non-host pine species. A no-choice breeding experiment was set up under laboratory conditions, using logs of three Mediterranean (Pinus pinea L., Pinus pinaster Miller, and Pinus halepensis Aiton) and two continental (Pinus nigra Arnold and Pinus sylvcstris L.) pine species. Log debarking at the end of adult emergence assessed parent fecundity egg, and larval mortality. The quality of callow adults emerging from each tested pine was evaluated on the basis of their longevity on a semiartificial diet. Tomicus destruens colonised all tested pine species, but did not reproduce in Scots pine, taking about 79 days to complete development with no differences among pines tested. The best breeding performance, evaluated as female fecundity and adult production, was observed in R halepensis, and the lowest in P. pinaster. On average, adults emerging from P. pinea survived longer (83 days) than from other pines, and adult longevity was the lowest in males emerging from R nigra.

Simple correlations and a modified chi-squared procedure are employed to investigate these relationships. Fall and spring soil moisture conditions appear to have some predictive capacity, showing strong associations to grasshopper abundance. Furthermore, regional relationships between temperature and soil moisture and the pest grasshopper populations are also identified. These relationships appear far stronger relative to low grasshopper populations, suggesting that population declines are easier to predict than outbreaks.

J,"Tran, JK; Ylioja, T; Billings, RF; Regniere, J; Ayres, MP",Impact of minimum winter temperatures on the population dynamics of Dendroctonus frontalis,"Predicting population dynamics is a fundamental problem in applied ecology. Temperature is a potential driver of short-term population dynamics, and temperature data are widely available, but we generally lack validated models to predict dynamics based upon temperatures. A generalized approach involves estimating the temperatures experienced by a population, characterizing the demographic consequences of physiological responses to temperature, and testing for predicted effects on abundance. We employed this approach to test whether minimum winter temperatures are a meaningful driver of pestilence from Dendroctonus frontalis ( the southern pine beetle) across the southeastern United States. A distance-weighted interpolation model provided good, spatially explicit, predictions of minimum winter air temperatures ( a putative driver of beetle survival). A Newtonian heat transfer model with empirical cooling constants indicated that beetles within host trees are buffered from the lowest air temperatures by; similar to 1-4 degrees C ( depending on tree diameter and duration of cold bout). The life stage structure of beetles in the most northerly outbreak in recent times ( New Jersey) were dominated by prepupae, which were more cold tolerant (by > 3 degrees C) than other life stages. Analyses of beetle abundance data from 1987 to 2005 showed that minimum winter air temperature only explained 1.5% of the variance in interannual growth rates of beetle populations, indicating that it is but a weak driver of population dynamics in the southeastern United States as a whole. However, average population growth rate matched theoretical predictions of a process-based model of winter mortality from low temperatures; apparently our knowledge of population effects from winter temperatures is satisfactory, and may help to predict dynamics of northern populations, even while adding little to population predictions in southern forests. Recent episodes of D. frontalis outbreaks in northern forests may have been allowed by a warming trend from 1960 to 2004 of 3.3 degrees C in minimum winter air temperatures in the southeastern United States.

The high dose-refuge (HDR) strategy aimed at delaying Bt resistance evolution depends on dispersal patterns of target pests. Examination of adult dispersal of the European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (ECB), the main target of Bt maize, can help to improve resistance management. Estimated recapture rates over 20 mark-release-recapture sessions in herbaceous field borders, where ECB adults rest during the day and mate at night, were used to examine the influence of sex, release period and site on ECB dispersal. Data from an additional 30 sessions were used to test the influence of night temperature, humidity, dew index and wind speed. Average recaptures within 50 m of release were lower 12 h after night (7.7%) than 12 h after day (34.5%) releases, did not differ between sexes, and decreased during nights with higher temperatures and lower wind speed. Local habitat had a major influence on dispersal. The number of unmarked adults caught initially in a given section of field border was strongly correlated with those subsequently captured in the same section, suggesting that moths flying in from the surroundings consistently settle in the same preferred spots. Moreover, recapture rates of marked adults were positively correlated with the prior density of unmarked adults in the release section. The spatial distribution of recaptured moths around the release point suggests that they moved on a very local scale, while those not recaptured probably left the area by a different, long-range type of dispersal. Synthesis and applications. A proportion of European corn borer adults typically remained within a few metres of their initial location for at least 12 h. This should favour non-random mating early in the flight season when nights are cold, population mixture is low and most individuals are unmated. Non-random mating can accelerate the evolution of resistance, but this effect may be offset by non-random oviposition. Our findings suggest that the intensity and direction of dispersal could be manipulated by field border management. Our data on the range and prevalence of short-range dispersal and the factors influencing this process, support the view that resistance evolution is multifactorial.

Four populations were followed in detail for three generations over 2 years, by monitoring the development and survival of 200 individuals in each population. Overall, preimaginal mortality among the generation studied varied from 56 to 94%. No evidence of disease or parasitism was present in the populations, and mortality was likely due to generalist predators. Weather records for the period were typical for the region, and periods of rainfall or elevated temperatures did not show any correlation with periods of mortality in the populations. Overall, the populations have high survival rates for whitefly populations, and this high survival is likely a major contributing factor to their pest status in California orchards.

Other less important pests are Gonocephalum simplex (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), Dysdercus fasciatus (Hemiptera: Pyrrhocoridae) and- Gryllus bimaculatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Bunches of grapes in vineyards were sampled for all phytosanitary pests during the 2003/2004 season, by both direct inspection and by shaking individual bunches to collect insects that fell. Insects moving up the vine trunk were collected with cardboard collars. The heads and bases of vines were also inspected. Cover crops and surrounding habitats were sampled by sweep netting. Pheromone traps, using E. acerbella pheromone capsules, were placed in vineyards. Abundance of pests was related to presence or absence of sticky trunk barriers, use of DiPel (R) (Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki), mean rainfall and maximum temperature, height and type of cover crop. The effects of surrounding habitats, time of day pests were active and the time of year they were found was also evaluated. Use of Plantex (R) trunk barriers gave effective preventive control of P. callosus. DiPel (R) was effective against E. acerbella larvae. Numbers of P. callosus weevils increased after periods of high ambient temperatures, while E. acerbella numbers decreased following rainfall. Most phytosanitary pests infested vineyards from adjacent vineyards, with few pests recorded in cover crops or in surrounding uncultivated habitats.

A combination of daytime nest temperatures and night air temperatures determines the number of hours larvae are able to feed (hours above realized feeding threshold, RFT). We tested the RFT-based model for survival across multiple areas of the insect's range in the Italian Alps over a 2-year period. In a series of translocation experiments using natural temperature gradients as spatial analogues for global warming, we transferred colonies of T pityocampa larvae to sites within zones of historical distribution, recent distribution, and outside the present range. The sites included traditional (Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris) as well as novel (Pinus mugo, Pinus uncinata, Pinus cembra) hosts. Survival during precold (August to November), cold (December to February) and postcold (March to May) periods were analysed against climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and predictors developed by the model. Host species did not significantly affect final survival, with the exception of slower larval development, and resulting lower cold tolerance, on P cembra than on R mugo at the same site. Across all the sites and hosts, final survival of colonies depended on the number of feeding hours during the cold period (RFT), which explained 82% of the variance in a regression model.

Developmental times for immature stages were inversely proportional to temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C but increased at 32.5 degrees C. Total developmental times from egg to adult emergence decreased from 69.6 to 17.1 d for temperatures from 15 to 30 degrees C, with pupae requiring more time for development than the combined egg and larva stages. Both linear and nonlinear (Logan equation VI) models provided a reliable fit of development rates versus temperature for all immature stages.

Development rate increased significantly with increasing temperature. Parameters of the linear regression equation did not differ among populations and common coefficients were calculated. Developmental zero, at and below which no development occurs, for pupae was 12.0 degrees C and the thermal constant was 476 day-degrees (D degrees). Minimum and maximum periods for pupal development were 26 days at 30 degrees C and 75 days at 18 degrees C, respectively. The phenology of pupae was determined in soil-filled cubicles in a shade house and in the field at Ayr (19 degrees 35'S, 147 degrees 25'E), north Queensland, using D. albohirtum field-collected as late-stage third-instar larvae and kept in containers. Pupation of D. albohirtum began in late August or early September and eclosion was complete by mid- to late October. The phenology data were used to validate the development model. Eclosion was predicted by summing hourly fractions of day-degrees until 476 D degrees was reached and was close to actual eclosion. As temperature, and hence pupal development rate, varies with soil depth, the distribution of the third instars in pupal cells in the soil profile was determined in recently harvested fields of sugarcane in the Burdekin sugarcane district centred on Ayr. Numbers of late third instars in pupal cells peaked at 300-400 mm, with pupae found from 30 to 700 mm. Pupal development was simulated using hourly soil temperatures measured at depths of 200 and 400 mm at Ayr and at Sarina (21 degrees 22'S, 149 degrees 13'E). The pupal stage was predicted to take up to 2-10 days longer at 200 mm deep than at 400 mm depending on pupation site and date.

Second, we tested the effects of temperature on the abundance of, and interactions among, fungi, mites and beetles within D. frontalis-infested trees. Fungi differed in their growth responses to temperature, resulting in changes in fungal-beetle associations. Mite species associated with D. frontalis also differed in their responses to temperature, resulting in different mite communities associated with bark beetle progeny. The effects of temperature on beetle reproduction could not be assessed because of high wood borer density, but inter-relations among surviving beetles, mites and fungi were altered by temperature.

J,"Logan, JA; Regniere, J; Gray, DR; Munson, AS",Risk assessment in the face of a changing environment: Gypsy moth and climate change in Utah,"The importance of efficaciously assessing the risk for introduction and establishment of pest species is an increasingly important ecological and economic issue. Evaluation of climate is fundamental to determining the potential success of an introduced or invasive insect pest. However, evaluating climatic suitability poses substantial difficulties; climate can be measured and assessed in a bewildering array of ways. Some physiological filter, in essence a lens that focuses climate through the requirements and constraints of a potential pest introduction, is required. Difficulties in assessing climate suitability are further exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is an exotic, tree-defoliating insect that is frequently introduced into the western United States. In spite of an abundance of potential host species, these introductions have yet to result in established populations. The success of eradication efforts and the unsuccessful establishment of many detected and undetected introductions may be related to an inhospitable climate. Climatic suitability for gypsy moth in the western United States, however, is potentially improving, perhaps rapidly, due to a general warming trend that began in the mid 1970s and continues today. In this work, we describe the application of a physiologically based climate suitability model for evaluating risk of gypsy moth establishment on a landscape level. Development of this risk assessment system first required amassing databases that integrated the gypsy moth climatic assessment model, with host species distributions, and climate (historical, present, and future). This integrated system was then used to evaluate climate change scenarios for native host species in Utah, with the result that risk of establishment will dramatically increase during the remainder of the 21st century under reasonable climate change scenarios. We then applied the risk assessment system to several case histories of detected gypsy moth introductions in Utah. These applications demonstrated the general utility of the system for predicting risk of establishment and for designing improved risk detection strategies.",no,,,,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1051-0761,1939-5582,2007,10.1890/1051-0761(2007)017[0101:RAITFO]2.0.CO;2,WOS:000245588400009

Our results showed that the development, body size and weight of SHB were dependent on temperature. Egg incubation was about two days at higher temperature (34 degrees C) and three days at lower (room) temperature (24-28 degrees C). Exposure of larvae to lower temperature resulted in a 15-day extension to their development to adult emergence with a mean of 36.31 +/- 0.08 days as opposed to 20.68 +/- 0.08 days at higher temperature (34 degrees C). At lower temperature, the developmental time (first instar to adult emergence) of males was about one-half day longer (36.63 +/- 0.12 days) than that of females (36.02 +/- 0.15 days). Higher temperature supported larger (length = 6.30 +/- 0.07 mm, width = 3.48 +/- 0.02 mm) and heavier (12.95 +/- 0.22 mg) adult females than did the lower temperature (length = 5.30 +/- 0.04 mm, width = 3.39 +/- 0.02 mm, weight = 11.40 +/- 0.20 mg).

Therefore, an optimal sampling scheme would allow determination of risk at minimal cost. Because the development of leafhopper nymphs and feeding injury is closely tied to temperature, a model driven by the accumulation of degree-days was developed to predict leafhopper cumulative abundance at 5, 50, and 95% levels in vineyards. The model was based on 22 data sets collected over 7 yr in three vineyards in southern Quebec. It was based on the cumulative abundance of nymphs of the eastern grape leafhopper; the grapevine leafhopper; the threebanded leafhopper; the Virginia creeper leafhopper; and Erythroneura vitifex Fitch. The lower threshold temperature for development was 8 degrees C. Paired t-tests and the forecasting efficiency confirmed the validity of the model. The model indicated that monitoring for leafhoppers in vineyards should be initiated at 630 DD (5% cumulative abundance) and terminated at 1,140 DD (95% cumulative abundance). Maximum abundance would be between 850 and 860 DD (50% cumulative abundance) calculated from 1 March.",no,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0046-225X,NA,2006,10.1603/0046-225X(2006)35[1477:MLNITV]2.0.CO;2,WOS:000242772900003

Consequently, several complementary methods are used to identify, collect and test putatively resistant individuals. A series of experiments conducted at commercial seed production facilities explored an alternative sampling method. Larvae of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner, were collected from bins containing Bt hybrid seed corn and their inbred progeny (both F-2 and backcross-F-2 larvae) were tested for resistance to the Bt toxin Cry1Ab. Marked, laboratory-reared O. nubilalis larvae also were placed beneath drying corn ears to evaluate potential contamination of samples by larvae developing on non-Bt corn. Both feral and laboratory-reared larvae were used to examine the causes and levels of mortality of larvae in drying bins. Screening of larvae on diet containing Cry1Ab failed to provide evidence of resistance, although insufficient inbred lines survived to make conclusions about the presence of resistance alleles in larvae originally collected beneath Bt corn. Both larvae from previously dried non-Bt corn and O. nubilalis moving between adjacent bins are potential sources of contamination of larvae collected beneath drying Bt corn. Exposure to conditions inside seed corn drying bins for 3 d significantly increased O. nubilalis mortality. Larvae collected beneath seed corn also showed infection by the pathogens Nosema pyrausta (Paillot) and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, with significant mortality apparently caused by B. bassiana.

Survival of diapause larvae during winter as affected by low temperatures is a key factor determining the range of PBW Winter survival was estimated using data from Gutierrez et al. (Can. Entomol. 109 (1977) 1457) and Venette et al. (Environ. Entomol. 29 (5) (2000) 1018). The model was run continuously over the period 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2003 using observed weather data from 121 locations. Three output variables were mapped as measures of PBW persistence: over-winter survival of diapause PBW larvae, cumulative daily PBW larval densities over the season, and the number of diapause larvae produced during the season. The distribution of pink bollworm is predicted to be restricted to the relatively frost-free cotton growing areas of Arizona and Southern California where it currently reaches pest status. The model predicts that extension of PBW's range into the Central Valley of California is unlikely The analysis questions the efficacy of an ongoing area-wide effort to prevent the establishment of PBW in the Central Valley of California. Four global warming scenarios were examined to estimate the effects on the potential geographic range of PBW Average observed daily temperatures were increased 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5 degrees C, respectively, in the four scenarios. Scenarios with average increases of 1.5-2.5 degrees C predicted that the range of PBW would expand into the Central Valley of California and the severity of the pest would greatly increase in areas of current infestation.

Body temperatures of the different codling moth stages were approximated by microhabitat temperatures, behavioural response to temperature, and biophysically modelled temperature increments due to absorption of solar radiation. Results indicate a significant influence of habitat parameters on the phenology of the codling moth. Under the simulated conditions, adults appeared up to 6 days earlier in dwarf trees than in standard trees, and up to 5 days later in trees covered with hail nets than in trees without them. In contrast, thermoregulation behaviour, which is documented for the larval and adult stages, appeared to be of relatively low influence on the insect's overall phenology. Model validation using reported pheromone trap catches of male moths agreed with the simulated appearance dates of adults of the overwintered generation. Simulated and observed appearance dates did not deviate when habitat temperature was used, but deviated considerably when standard air temperature was used as driving variable. Considering habitat and behaviour will help to improve current phenology models for the codling moth. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In Europe, the native pentatomid predator Picromerus bidens (Linnaeus) has been considered a potential alternative to the North American pentatomid Podisus maculiventris (Say) for the control of lepidopteran, coleopteran and hymenopteran defoliator pests. In the current study, prey consumption and developmental duration of the predatory stages of P. bidens and P. maculiventris were investigated at three temperatures (18, 23 and 27 degrees C) in the laboratory using caterpillars of Spodoptera littoralis as prey. Development time from second to fifth instar was longer for P. bidens than for P. maculiventris, taking on average 17-44 and 14-32 days, respectively, at the different temperatures. Total nymphal consumption of fourth instar S. littoralis caterpillars indicated a greater voracity of P. bidens as compared with P. maculiventris at both the low and high temperatures tested (18 and 27 degrees C). At 23 degrees C, however, the predation rate of P. maculiventris nymphs exceeded that of P. bidens nymphs. Effect of temperature on the functional response of P. bidens to densities of fourth instar Spodoptera exigua was assessed on potted green bean plants. Female adults of P. bidens exhibited a type II functional response at 18 and 23 degrees C but a type III response at 27 degrees C. Searching efficiency was not affected by temperature but handling time decreased from 4.2 to 1.4 h as temperature increased from 18 to 23 degrees C. However, the predator spent twice as much time handling prey at 27 degrees C (2.9 h) than at 23 degrees C.

General stored-product insect activity was also monitored using unbaited sticky traps positioned inside the warehouses around overhead doors. Pheromone-baited traps were useful for monitoring R. dominica activity, however insect captures decreased when lures were not changed weekly. Flight peaks were documented in early May and again from September through October, and insect captures inside warehouses correlated with timing of outdoor captures. Multiple regression analyses showed that slightly more than half of the variability in R. dominica captures could be explained by mean ambient air temperature and wind speed during the 2 h preceding sunset. Stored-product Coleoptera captured on unbaited glue boards around overhead doors included Ahasverus advena, Cryptolestes ferrugineus, R. dominica, Sitophilus oryzae, Tribolium castaneum, Trogoderma variabile, and Typhaea stercorea. Door gaskets significantly reduced the number of insect captures on glue boards placed around the overhead doors, and generally restricted their entry to ground level.

The exponential increase of T. urticae populations during three growing seasons permits the development and use of a simple exponential model for the design of a threshold-based chemical control system. For this purpose, a critical threshold of 440 motile mites per sample unit at the end of the growing season (12 weeks after transplanting) was translated into a proportion of 0.83 infested units in sample 3, i.e. five weeks after transplanting. A sequential binomial sampling plan with respect to the proportion of 0.83, five weeks after transplanting, was designed. The exponential model was extended to account for the influence of weather and host plant species. Model development and parameter estimation were based on three data sets (Kenyan tomato fields, Italian and Californian strawberry fields). The model satisfactorily predicted a positive influence on growth rates by (i) changing the host plant from tomato to strawberry, and (ii) temperature, while a negative effect resulted from (iii) rainfall; both (ii) and (iii) are controlled by temperature-rainfall interactions.

Developmental times were recorded for G. scutellatus life stages: egg to first instar larva, first instar to pre-pupal larva, prepupae to adults and the complete life cycle. Experiments were performed in temperature-con trolled chambers maintained at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C with a photoperiod of 11 : 13 h of light : darkness and 50-60% RH. To calculate the minimum threshold temperature of the parasitoid, parasitized egg capsules were kept under similar conditions. During 1998 and 1999 we studied the phenology and the day-degree (DD) accumulation of G. scutellatus and its parasitoid in plots of Eucalyptus globulus at six different sites in NW Spain. Every 2 weeks, the numbers of snout beetle adults and egg capsules were counted in each plot. The rate of parasitism was estimated by collecting 90 egg capsules from each plot on each sampling date. We recorded the temperatures in each plot to test whether differences in temperature alone could account for the phenology of this snout beetle. To complete a full life cycle from egg to adult, the weevil required a mean of 1119.83 +/- 20.59 DD above a base temperature of 6.11 degrees C. The parasitoid had a base temperature of 5.09 degrees C and needed 318.16 DD to complete a life cycle. Our model indicated that three generations of snout beetle could develop each year, corresponding to peaks of snout beetle numbers in the field in March April, June-July and November. In some years only one generation of G. scutellatus was recorded due probably to the effectiveness of the parasitoid. Differences in numbers of adults and egg capsule were recorded between neighbouring 'coastal plots' and between neighbouring 'inland plots'.

The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of temperature on development, longevity, fecundity, and population growth of T. nigriabdominalis and to assess the effects of host plant on development of T. nigriabdominalis. The effects of temperature on performance of this root aphid were determined at 10, 15,20,25,30, and 35 +/- 1 degrees C on rice roots, Oryza sativa L. Nymphal stages from birth to adult decreased from 46.3 d at 10 degrees C to 8.5 d at 30 degrees C. Aphid survival and development were lowest at 35 degrees C, and no aphid produced progeny at this temperature. Average adult longevity decreased from 23.3 d at 15 degrees C to 8.2 d at temperatures up to 35 degrees C. Average number of nymphs produced per female was highest at 26 degrees C; averaging near 30 nymphs per female, but it dropped to near zero at both 10 and 35 degrees C.

J,"Noronha, C; Cloutier, C",Effects of potato foliage age and temperature regime on prediapause Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae),"Feeding on mature potato foliage and low temperatures can influence diapause preparation and winter survival in insects adapted to northern regions such as the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). The effects of potato leaf maturity and temperature regimen, in a full factorial combination, on prediapause feeding, digging depth in the soil, and survival after a brief exposure to -2 degrees C were studied in beetles induced to diapause under short day conditions in the laboratory. Newly emerged adults were fed either younger or older potato leaves (cultivar Norland) at temperatures cycling daily according to a sine wave averaging 17 or 11.5 degrees C. As expected, time spent feeding before satiation was significantly longer at 11.5 degrees C (25 +/- 1.12 [SE] d) than at 17 degrees C (17 +/- 0.37 d); leaf age or its interaction with temperature had no significant effect. Beetles consumed older foliage at a faster rate, especially at the 17 degrees C regime. Cumulative fresh weight of older leaves consumed before satiation was 45% higher (3.50 +/- 0.07 g/beetle) than young leaves (2.25 +/- 0.05 g/beetle); temperature regime and the interaction were nonsignificant. Despite variation in feeding rate and feeding time before satiation, weight gain during prediapause (25-30 mg/individual) remained nearly constant over all factor combinations. Thus, metabolic reserves for overwintering in terms of weight gain are more or less fixed, and any variations in food quality and temperature are compensated for by varying feeding behavior. Satiated prediapause beetles showed no significant variation of postfeeding delay before initiating digging; this delay averaged 8 d under all conditions. Mean depth reached in soil columns before final resting was 30 +/- 2.1 cm at 11.5 degrees C compared with 45 +/- 2.4 cm at 17 degrees C, with no significant effect of leaf age or interaction. Thus, feeding on older foliage did not affect overwintering depth. Survival after a 4-h cold shock at -2 degrees C, after 6 mo at 4 degrees C, was 59% for beetles under the 17 degrees C regime during prediapause compared with 84% for those under the 11.5 degrees C regime during prediapause. Our results show that a higher temperature regime during prediapause preparation reduces beetle resistance to frost in late dormancy, but beetles dig deeper at high temperatures, which could compensate for the higher risk of freezing.",yes,experimental,laboratory,consumption,,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0046-225X,1938-2936,2006,10.1603/0046-225X-35.3.590,WOS:000238238300003

J,"Traugott, M",Habitat use and activity patterns of larval and adult Cantharis beetles in arable land,"Generalist predators play a key role in agriculturally and environmentally sustainable systems of pest control. A detailed knowledge on their ecology, however, is needed to improve management practices to maximize their service of pest control. The present study examines the habitat use and activity patterns of larval and adult Cantharis beetles that are abundant predators in arable land. Laboratory experiments revealed that sixth instar larvae of Cantharis fusca and Cantharis livida significantly preferred high relative humidity levels of 85-90% to lower ones. This can explain their preference for meadows over fields due to the more favorable microclimatic conditions in the former habitats. Surface activity of sixth instar Cantharis larvae during autumn, winter and early spring occurred at soil temperatures above 0 degrees C. However, no correlation between surface activity and soil temperature, air temperature or relative humidity was found above 0 degrees C. Catches of sixth instar Cantharis larvae within fenced pitfall traps were higher in a meadow (Mean +/- S.D.; 13.8 +/- 7.63 individuals m(-2)) than in a field (4.60 +/- 2.89 individuals m(-2)). Mark-recapture density estimations for sixth instar larvae indicated mean densities of 25.9 +/- 5.63 (field) and 42.8 +/- 16.0 individuals m(-2) (meadow). The same pattern was found for adult emergence rates in the field (0.17 +/- 0.39 adults m(-2)) and meadow (1.83 +/- 1.17 adults m(-2)) as well as for adult densities in the vegetation (field 4.89 +/- 3.62 adults 60 m(-2); meadow 12.5 +/- 11.2 adults 60 m(-2)).

In 2003, peak emergence occurred during a 3-wk period from 28 May to 13 June when 97.6% of C. obstrictus were collected; and in 2004, emergence of 55.6% of weevils occurred during the 1-wk period before 4 June. Peak emergence occurred as mean ground temperature (5 cm in depth) reached 15 degrees C. The greatest number of weevils recorded from a single 1-m(2) emergence trap was 956. Significantly more weevils emerged from sheltered and intermediately sheltered locations than from open grassy habitats; sheltered areas were predominantly shelterbelts and yard sites of caragana and poplar trees. No weevils emerged from 14 of 106 cages, and all cages were in open grassy habitat. Spring emergence of weevils in open grassy areas occurred slightly before those in sheltered and intermediately sheltered areas.

Here, we compared the relative abundance of these fruit pests in 26 fruit species sampled from 62 localities of Argentina in regions where C. capitata and A. fraterculus coexist. In general, C. capitata was predominant over A. fraterculus (97.46% of the emerged adults were C. capitata), but not always. Using the number of emerged adults of each species, we calculated a relative abundance index (RAI) for each host in each locality. RAI is the abundance of C. capitata relative to the combined abundance of A.fraterculus and C. capitata. Some families of fruit species were more prone to show high (Rutaceae and Rosaceae) or low (Myrtaceae) RAI values, and also native plants showed lower RAI values than introduced plants. RAI showed high variation among host species in different localities, suggesting a differential use of these hosts by the two flies. There were localities where A. fraterculus was not found in spite of suitable temperature and the presence of hosts. Most host species showed little variation in RAI among localities, usually favoring C. capitata, but peach, grapefruit, and guava showed high variation. This suggests that these fruit species are suitable for both fruit flies but more favorable to one or the other, depending on local environmental conditions (e.g., relative humidity and degree of disturbance) of each locality.",no,,,,,ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0013-8746,1938-2901,2006,10.1603/0013-8746(2006)099[0070:RAOCCA]2.0.CO;2,WOS:000234727400009

To understand the mechanism of seasonal occurrence of this insect pest, we developed a population dynamics model that explicitly incorporates the temperature-dependent development of the pest. The model predictions were compared with observed captures in pheromone traps at the experimental site of the Kagoshima Tea Experiment Research Station in Japan. The results showed that the emergence timing of the insect pest observed in the field was determined primarily by temperature. The relationship between the timing of adult emergence and the leaf damage level was also studied using a logistic regression model. The infestation level decreased as the interval between the adult peak emergence date and the date of tea plucking increased, implying that asynchrony between plant phenology and emergence of the insect pest is a critical factor reducing damage level. We examined how the damage level changes according to global warming. Increased temperature made the timing of insect appearance forward and enhance asynchrony of plant-pest phenology. Therefore, reduction of damage level by the insect pest is expected under global warming.",yes,field,damage,,,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0912-3814,NA,2006,10.1007/s11284-005-0099-9,WOS:000234752300014

Some cereals infested by C. bipunctata, such as maize and rice, exhibit stunted growth and severe swelling of leaf veins, symptoms commonly referred to as 'wallaby ear disease'. Though previous studies attributed the symptoms to a leafhopper-transmitted virus, recent studies suggest that chemicals injected by C. bipunctata during feeding are important contributors to these symptoms. Therefore the damage is considered a sort of insect gall. Following the initiation of biyearly plantings of forage maize in Kyushu, Japan, C. bipunctata became recognized as a serious insect pest of forage maize. Since 2001 the total area of forage maize fields damaged by C bipunctata has gradually increased, and outbreaks of C bipunctata occurred in 2004. We speculate that relatively low winter mortality and early appearance of C bipunctata are possible factors contributing to recent outbreaks. In central Kyushu, an increase of 1.3 generations per year following global warming is estimated for C bipunctata by 2100, relative to 1990. Thus, C bipunctata has the potential to become a serious insect pest of cereal crops other than forage maize in the future.",no,,,,,GALLING ARTHROPODS AND THEIR ASSOCIATES: ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NA,International Symposium on Gall-Inducing Arthropods,"SEP 05-09, 2005","Tokyo, JAPAN","Japan Soc Promot Sci, Int Union Forestry Res Org Japan, Kyoto Univ, 21st Century COE Program",NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,2006,10.1007/4-431-32185-3_12,WOS:000237450900012

Changes in the pest status, distribution range, winter mortality, and the synchronization in phenology were examined. The increase in the number of annual generations of each taxon was predicted based on the lower developmental threshold and the thermal constant. Increasing damage due to rice- and fruit-infesting bugs, their simultaneous outbreaks and the poleward geographic spread observed for six species may be triggered by global warming. The winter mortality of adults of Nezara viridula and Halyomorpha halys is predicted to be reduced by 15% by each rise of 1 degrees C. More than 50 species of butterflies showed northward range expansions and ten species of previously migrant butterflies established on Nansei Islands during 1966-1987. Global warming may be responsible for the recent decline in abundance of Plutella xylostella and the increase in Helicoverpa armigera and Trichoplusia ni. In general, global warming may work in favour of natural enemies (except for spiders) by increasing the number of generations more than in their host species. Biological control utilizing native natural enemies is expected to become a more important control tactic in the future. Greenhouse culture may provide a model of a temperate agroecosystem after global warming. The increasing occurrence of alien species of tropical origin in association with the increase in pesticide applications might be expected.

Long-term data are important for the elucidation of such mechanisms. In this article we analyze the 50-year dynamics of annual light-trap catches of three insect pest species living in paddy fields in Japan: the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae); the green rice leafhopper, Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Deltocephalidae); and the small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus (Fallen) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). We separate the long-term dynamics into two components by using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing: (1) the underlying dynamics of populations, and (2) the influence of the past changes in the environment. The former component is analyzed by response surface analysis and vector autoregression to evaluate the nonlinearity of density-dependence and the inter-specific influence of density, respectively. On the basis of these analyses, we perform the state-space model analyses. The state-space model selected by Akaike's information criterion indicates that the observed number of light-trap catches of C. suppressalis and N. cincticeps in summer increases with increasing temperatures in the previous winter. It also indicates that the influence of temperature is not carried over to the next year.

Although there usually is an overabundance of diverse stable fly and house fly, Musca domestica L., larval habitats in confined livestock operations, no larval habitat for stable flies has been clearly identified in the pasture-range environment. Because the winter feeding of bay in round bales results in significant amounts of bay wastage that when mixed with manure, might develop into suitable larval habitats, this study evaluated these areas as developmental sites for the abundant stable flies in pastures. There was a trend for fly traps placed in the vicinity of hay feeding sites to catch more stable flies than those placed distant from these sites. Estimates of stable flies emerging from these sites ranged from 102 to 1225 flies per core sample (25 by 25 cm). The mean number of adult stable flies during May and June 2001 through 2004 correlated negatively with the average minimum temperatures during the preceding winter (November-February) but not with rainfall or temperatures during the spring.

Adult weevils feed and oviposit in buds, flowers, and, especially, fruit. Larvae develop and feed inside those plant structures, thus reducing crop yields. Management is difficult and requires precise knowledge of developmental times and thresholds for maximum efficiency. Therefore, the developmental biology and life history parameters of A. eugenii were characterized in the laboratory on Capsicum annuum 'Jalapeno fruits at seven constant temperatures ranging from 15 to 33 degrees C. A. eugenii developed through three instars at all temperatures. Linear regression analysis estimated a lower developmental threshold of 9.6 degrees C and a degree-day requirement of 256.4 for development from egg to adult. Fecundity increased with increasing temperatures to a maximum at 30 degrees C but declined at 33 degrees C. Net reproductive rate (R.), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), and finite rate of increase (A) were greatest at 30 degrees C, whereas development time and mortality were least at this temperature regimen. Thus, 30 degrees C proved to be the optimal temperature for population increase because a maximum fecundity of 3.1 eggs/ female/ d, the shortest development time of 12.9 d, minimal mortality, and the highest life history parameters were obtained.

The aim of the research was to determine if Chinese cabbage is an appropriate trap crop for this pest in the production of white cabbage, an important vegetable in Europe and in North America. The number of beetles on Chinese cabbage in monoculture and in mixed crop did not differ significantly. In both treatments the number of adults of flea beetles on Chinese cabbage and the percentage of damaged leaf area they caused, were significantly higher than that on white cabbage. Statistically significant and positive correlation was established between leaf damage and number of flea beetles. It was stronger in 2003, which was less favorable for the crop with regards to the weather conditions (drought and high air temperatures). No significant differences were found in the number of adults and in most evaluations also in the damage assessments on white cabbage when grown in monoculture and in mixed culture.

Quantification of the relationship between stage development and temperature is required to predict seasonal occurrence of particular life stages and to optimize the timing of monitoring and control tactics. 2 Temperature-dependent survival rate was quantified using an extreme value function and showed a skewed bell shape, due to the vulnerability of the insect to high temperature in all stages. 3 The development times of O. sulcatus decreased with increasing temperature up to 27 degrees C for eggs and 24 degrees C for larvae and pupae. The nonlinear relationship between development rate and temperature was described using the Logan model, and enabled us to estimate the optimum temperature for development. 4 The inherent variation of development time was estimated from the cumulative frequency of stage emergence, which was modelled using the cumulative Weibull function. 5 The stage emergence model, which simulated the transition from one stage to the next in relation to temperature and cohort age, was constructed by incorporating stage-specific survival and development rate submodels with the Weibull model of stage frequency. 6 Our results show a difference in optimal temperature regime among developmental stages of O. sulcatus.",no,,,,,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1461-9555,1461-9563,2005,10.1111/j.1461-9555.2005.00260.x,WOS:000231005200004

Local estimates of monthly averaged air temperatures for five locations in Slovenia were adjusted for an additional four emission scenarios (SRES A1T, A1F1, A1B, and B1) using a pattern scaling technique. They were further transferred to a daily scale using a first-order autoregressive model, A simple degree-day model, based on data reported in the literature, was used to relate the development of onion thrips to temperature. Potential changes in the period with favorable developmental conditions for onion thrips (i.e., temperatures above the lower developmental threshold) and in the number of generations per season were estimated with regard to the expected future climate change in Slovenia. The changes are influenced by the magnitude of temperature increase, its asymmetry within the year, and present climate conditions.

The general biology of this recently described sawfly species is little known and in the present study we used a synthetic pheromone to monitor its flight period and to evaluate the possibility to use pheromone traps as a tool for estimating and predicting population densities. The attractant pheromone of D. jingyuanensis is (1S,2R,6R)-1,2,6-trimethyldodecyl propionate and in this study we used a four-isomer threo-mixture containing the active attractant. Both doses tested, 1 and 2 mg/trap, revealed the same seasonal flight pattern, the higher dosage demonstrating more clear flight peaks. The first flight peak of D. jingyuanensis occurred in mid-June during all 3 years, 1997-1999, and in 1997 and 1998 a second flight peak was also recorded in mid-July. The flight period was similar in time for populations located at higher (1400 m) and lower altitude (1100 m), from early June to late July or early August. Temperature was the main weather factor-affecting trap catches. Diurnal flight activity began at 9.00, peaked at 13.00 and lasted until 20.00. A series of tests with traps in different positions within stands and trees were conducted and the results demonstrated the importance of standardizing the trapping protocol in population monitoring studies. By using traps with 2 mg baits it is possible to detect sawfly occurrence at very low population densities, not detectable by other means. Strong positive correlations between trap catch and relative population density were found in 2000 and 2001, but not in 1998, when only few sites were monitored and the population was in a decreasing phase.

Female fecundity and longevity were evaluated in a temperature-gradient experiment. As predicted, females of woodland landscape origin reached higher maximum daily fecundity and lifetime number of eggs than did agricultural landscape females at low ambient temperatures, but this reversed at high ambient temperature. Egg weight decreased with temperature, and eggs of woodland butterflies were smaller. Contrary to what is generally assumed, remaining thorax mass was a better predictor of lifetime reproductive output than was abdomen mass. Since we used the F2 generation from wild-caught females reared under common garden conditions, the observed effects are likely to rely on intrinsic, heritable variation.

The main objectives were to determine the predominant geographical, climatic and land use factors that are linked with the aphid's distribution, to quantify their role in determining that distribution, including their interacting effects and to explore the ability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to provide predictive models. Location The study focused on four spatial scales to account for the aphid data base characteristics and available land use data sets: Europe; a broad zone over Europe covering Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden and Wales (Regio data base coverage); North-West Europe (i.e. Belgium, France and the United Kingdom); and England with Wales. Methods Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to identify the variables in the Geographic location, Climate and Land use groups, that explained significant proportions of the variance in M. persicae total annual numbers and Julian date of first capture. A variance partitioning procedure was used to measure the fraction of the variation that can be explained by each environmental factor and of shared variation between the different factors. Finally, ANNs were employed as an alternative modelling approach for the two largest study areas, i.e. Europe and the Regio data base coverage, to determine whether the relationship between aphid and environmental variables was better described by more complex functions as well as their ability to generalize to new data. Results Land use variables are shown to play a significant role in explaining aphid numbers. The area of agricultural crops, in particular oilseed rape, is positively correlated with M. persicae annual numbers. Among the climatic variables, rainfall is negatively correlated with aphid numbers and temperature is positively correlated. The geographical components also explain a significant part of aphid annual numbers. However, the variance partitioning procedure indicates that while each group has an effect, none is dominant. Aphid first capture is mainly explained by climate where rainfall tends to delay migration and warmer conditions tend to advance it. Climate accounts for the greatest part of the variance when considered separately from the other factors. The geographical and land use components also have a significant effect on first capture at each scale, but their direct contribution is negligible. The ability of the ANN models to generalize to new total numbers and phenological data compared with MLR models was less for Europe (9 and 6% increase in the variance accounted for, respectively) than for the Regio data coverage where an increase of 44% in the variance accounted for was observed. Main conclusions This research supports the hypothesis that climate, land use and geographical location play a role in determining patterns of aphid annual numbers and phenology. The ability of ANN models to predict aphid distribution is improved by the inclusion of temporal land use data. However, identification of the processes involved in such relationships is difficult due to numerous interactions between the environmental factors.",yes,field,abundance,,,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0305-0270,NA,2005,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01190.x,WOS:000228017800006

We explored the effects of temperature, treatment time, controlled atmospheres, and vacuum in combination with O-3 to control two important pests of ornamental crops: western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), and longtailed mealybug, Pseudococcus longispinus Targioni Tozzetti. Treatment parameters tested were O-3 concentrations from 0 to 3,800 ppm, treatment durations were from 30 to 120 min, vacuums were from 0 to 0.41 bar below ambient, temperatures were from 32.2 to 40.6 degrees C, and controlled atmospheres were composed primarily of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or breathing air [BA]. Treatment efficacy was enhanced by higher O-3 concentration and temperature, lower oxygen, and longer treatment times. Reduced pressure was not an important factor. Mealybugs were more difficult to kill than thrips. A 30-min treatment of O-3 at approximate to 200 ppm in 100% CO2 at 37.8 degrees C killed 47.9 and 98.0% of mealybugs and adult female thrips, respectively. All of the ornamentals tested were damaged to some degree by O-3 treatments.

We sampled both the prey and predators using flight traps baited with the synthetic aggregation pheromone of I. pini. Flight models were constructed using weather variables (temperature and precipitation), counts of bark beetles and their predators, and temporal variables to incorporate possible effects of seasonality. The number of I. pini per weekly collection period was temperature dependent and decreased with the number of predators, specifically T. dubius in 2001 and P. cylindrica in 2002. The number of predators captured each week was also weather dependent. The predators had similar seasonal phenologies, and the number of each predator species was positively correlated with the other. Including a term for the number of prey did not improve the model fits for either predator for either year. Our results suggest that exogenous weather factors strongly affect the flight activity of I. pini, but that its abundance is also affected by direct density-dependent processes acting over weekly time scales.

One of the main reasons for extensive insecticide application is the lack of information about factors that control insect population.

The beating tray method, direct counting and magnifying lens were used to estimate the number of these pests, predators and parasitoids. Median temperature, sunlight and relative humidity correlated to the amount of leaf nonacosane, which in turn was associated with aphids population increase. A tendency in the reduction of aphids and thrips populations with increase in total rainfall was observed. The whitefly can be a harmful pest in kale producing regions of higher temperature and smaller rainfall.

A common method of nonrefrigerated storage is to pile potatoes in straw-covered heaps in the field. Tubers may be stored up to 3-4 mo in this manner, until the next harvest. We studied the dynamics of potato tuber moth infestation associated with such field storage in a 12-wk experiment in Israel. We set up six potato heaps, and sampled them for potato tuber moth at different locations at weekly intervals. Potato tuber moth infestation was significantly higher at the perimeter of the heaps than at their center, but it did not differ between bottom, mid-height, and top of the heaps. The proportion of potato tuber moth-infested potato tubers increased from 10 to 65% over the course of the experiment, and the mean number of potato tuber moth larvae per tuber increased from 0.25 to 2.50. Potato tuberworm populations increased sharply after 3, 6, and 9 wk of study, possibly corresponding to successive generations that developed within the heaps. This interpretation is supported by calculations of potato tuberworm generation length based on temperature data. Catches in pheromone traps that were placed near the heaps were not correlated (spatially and temporally) with potato tuberworm densities within heaps, hinting that migration among heaps did not considerably affect within-heap population dynamics. Potato tuberworm levels were not correlated with ambient temperatures, perhaps because of the warm, humid, and constant microclimate within the heaps.

Its population dynamics were studied using field observations and long-term monitoring to find suitable management methods. Observations of bugs reared in netting bags showed a sequence of change in bug-damage symptoms after 12 h and up to 3 d. Field observations revealed that adults preferred to feed and rest on the shady side of the tree. The number of bugs observed accounted for only 17-35% of the total variability in the number of damaged shoots, suggesting that the number of flushing shoots (leaf, flower or young nuts) with fresh damage symptoms was a more reliable parameter for determining the presence and level of activity of bugs than was a direct estimate of the number of bugs. The green tree ant, Oecophylla smaragdina (F), was the most important factor regulating bug populations. When predation was excluded as a factor, the number of flushing shoots and maximum temperature accounted for 80% of the total variability in the bug damage.

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is one of the most serious pests of horticultural crops but despite this, the effects of temperature on its reproduction are not fully understood. This study investigates the effects of temperature on the full set of reproductive traits of O. sulcatus at nine temperatures between 11 and 36 degreesC and develops descriptive models for each trait. Cohorts of newly eclosed adults were subjected to these temperatures and fed on Rhododendron spec. leaves. Adults oviposited at temperatures from 11 to 27 degreesC. Significant differences among treatments were found in the preoviposition period, oviposition period, longevity, per capita egg production, and egg viability. The preoviposition period was the shortest at 24 degreesC and the longest at 11 degreesC. With a non-linear model fitted to the data across the full range of experimental temperatures, the lower and upper threshold temperatures and optimum temperature for reproductive maturation were estimated to be 6.8, 30.0, and 22.7 degreesC, respectively. The developmental threshold and calculated thermal constant were estimated to be 6.7 degreesC and 505.0 degree-days, respectively, using a linear model at temperatures between 11 and 21 degreesC. Maximum per capita egg production (1094.1 eggs) and highest egg viability (90.1%) were both observed at 21 degreesC. The median longevity of O. sulcatus adults in the 18-36 degreesC range decreased linearly as temperatures increased. At 27 degreesC or above, the reproductive success of O. sulcatus was substantially impaired, and the optimum temperature range was 21-22 degreesC. Production of viable eggs in relation to temperature and weevil age was simulated by incorporating four models of life history traits, including egg production, egg viability, cumulative pattern of egg production, and adult survival. Overall, the present study demonstrates that temperature is a key factor in determining the reproductive success of O. sulcatus adults.

Degree-day (DD) models were developed to predict the emergence date of adult rice water weevils from overwintering in the spring and to describe larval and pupal development on two varieties of rice under field conditions. The model that best described emergence of weevils from overwintering was derived from 14 yr of light trap captures. The temperature threshold for the best-fit model was 15.6degreesC, the start date for the model (date at which degree-day accumulation begins) was 33 d after 1 January, and the end point for the model was a cumulative light trap capture of six weevils. By using these parameters, emergence of weevils occurred after accumulation of 139.2 DD (degreesC X day).

At temperatures between 15 and 30 degrees C more than 89% of eggs hatched and of the newly hatched larvae ca. 89% attained maturity. There was no significant difference in eclosion rate of eggs or survival rate of immature stages among the temperatures.

Plant Sci. 84: 1171-1182. The levels of infestation and damage to canola taproots caused by crucifer-feeding root maggots (Delia spp.)(Diptera: Anthomyiidae) were determined through surveys of commercial crops across the canola growing regions of western Canada. Canola root damage caused by Delia spp. maggots was measured at the end of the season by determining the percentage of plants infested (PPI) per field and estimating average damage levels (DL, on a scale of O to 5) to taproots. Over the course of the survey, 2890 canola fields were sampled. Infestation by root maggots occurred wherever canola is grown in western Canada. In the study, 96% of the fields surveyed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and 99.8% of the fields in Alberta showed evidence of root maggot feeding, with PPI much higher than in provincial surveys of a decade previously. Geographical ecoregion significantly affected both PPI and DL. The greatest amount of damage over the largest area was found in western and northwestern Alberta, although localized areas with severely damaged roots occurred along the northern edge of the entire Parkland ecoregion. Over the entire survey area, Brassica rapa L. roots had greater PPI and DL than B. napus L. roots, although species differences were not significant in Saskatchewan or Manitoba. Data from the survey were correlated with weather variables to develop a model predicting the levels of damage inflicted by root maggots to canola roots. Of the weather variables investigated, temperature, especially the average temperature in the preceding July and August, had the greatest influence on PPI and DL. The warmer the temperatures of the preceding July and August, the lower the PPI and DL in the current year. Likewise, previous year's July and August precipitation influenced PPI and DL negatively. Other weather parameters had little consistent influence on PPI and DI. The predictive model for PPI and DL, developed from the 1995-1998 survey data, incorporated canola species, ecoregion, previous July-August and September-October temperatures and precipitation. The validity of the model was assessed using a set of survey data collected in Alberta from 1981 to 1983. Regression equations of predicted results on actual results were significant. However, r(2) values for the regressions were low, in part because of the few ecoregions surveyed and the lack of canola species data recorded in the earlier survey, and because of the large increase in infestation levels since the earlier data were collected.

Temperature-dependent development of C. claratris was studied at seven constant temperatures, i.e. 22, 25, 27, 30, 34, 35 and 40degreesC. Pre-adult survivorship was greatest (95%) at 25 and 30degreesC and shortest at 22degreesC. Egg-to-adult time decreased within the range of 20 to 30degreesC and at 34degreesC it started to increase. The lower thermal threshold for egg-to-adult development was estimated at 16 and 18degreesC by linear regression and the modified Logan model, respectively. The optimum temperature for egg-to-adult development was estimated at 32-33degreesC by the modified Logan model. The influence of temperature on reproduction and longevity of C. claratris was determined at 25, 30 and 35 and 40degreesC. Both inseminated and virgin females failed to reproduce at 40degreesC. Virgin females produced only male offspring, confirming arrhenotoky. The sex ratio of the offspring of fertilized females was strongly female-biased, except at 25degreesC. Mean total fecundity per female and mean daily total fecundity per female were highest for both virgin and inseminated females at 30degreesC. Female longevity was longest at 25degreesC and shortest at 40degreesC. Male longevity was longest at 30degreesC and shortest at 40degreesC. The net reproductive rate (R-0) and intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) was greatest at 30degreesC while, mean generation time (G) and the doubling time (t) were highest at 25degreesC.

(Homopt., Aphididae) on plantain and as migrant to apple","The rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini) is a key pest in western European apple orchards; the economic damage threshold is so low that outbreaks cannot be forecasted. A mass rearing of the species on plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) was initiated, with the aim to infest apple trees with either the autumn migrants, gynoparae and males, or the egg-laying females (oviparae). Here, data are presented about the propagation of the species on plantain, on the production of autumn migrants under laboratory conditions, and on the duration of juvenile development and reproductive capacities of both gynoparae and oviparae. Under long-day conditions (18 h light/day) on plantain, the thermal constant for the duration of juvenile development was 166 dd (day-degrees) above the lower development threshold of 5.1 degreesC, and daily larviposition amounted to 1.87 times the temperature (degreesC)minus 0.8, above a lower threshold of 4.3 degreesC. Between 32 and 36 larvae were produced by the young female before the first larvae become adult and their reproduction started to overshadow their mother's. A plant freshly infested with 12 reproducing females and transferred to short-day conditions (12 h light/day) yielded up to 5,000 autumn migrants, with males in the majority. The first gynoparae appeared after about 25 days at both 16 and 20 degreesC, and males appeared after 40 and 33 days, respectively. Young adult gynoparae produced most of their about ten offspring right after landing on apples, unless temperature was well below 15 degreesC. The duration of juvenile development of these oviparae appeared to be rather variable and their egg-laying so protracted that each of these females needs to survive several weeks to produce a handful of winter eggs.

Walp., plants were used to determine the effects of defoliation and pod position relative to the leaf canopy on infestation and damage by the coreid pod-bugs Clavigralla tomentosicollis Stal and Anoplocnemis curvipes (F.). Temperature measurements were taken within and outside the canopy to determine whether there was a correlation to seed damage. Seed damage decreased significantly with increasing defoliation in plants infested with C. tomentosicollis; an inverse trend was observed with A. curvipes. Temperatures within the canopy increased as the number of leaves decreased. As observed in the defoliation experiment, C. tomentosicollis and A. curvipes reacted differently in a free-choice situation between pods located outside or within the canopy. Significantly higher numbers of C. tomentosicollis concealed themselves within the canopy, where they caused more severe damage to seeds, in comparison with numbers and damage outside the canopy. These trends were reversed for A. curvipes. There was a significant negative correlation between percentage of seed damage and temperature with C. tomentosicollis, and a significant positive correlation with A. curvipes, both in defoliated plants and those with pods distributed outside and within the canopy. Overall, plants with less dense canopy, and long peduncles holding, pods outside the canopy showed some resistance to C. tomentosicollis, which is the most damaging pod bug on cowpea.

After examining several body dimensions during apterous aphid development (antennal length, head width, body length, and abdominal width), antennal length was found to be the best indicator of an instar. Apterous aphids completed development from nymph to adult in approximate to8 d and passed through four instars.

The population dynamics and life stage composition of T tabaci populations and the predaceous natural enemy populations on onions were determined in three consecutive seasons from 2000 to 2002. T tabad were first present on onion plants in early February, increased in numbers gradually, and peaked in abundance in late March and early April. Visual counts of field populations revealed approximate to75% of total thrips; and at least 77% of total predators by absolute counts. Developmental stages of T tabaci on onion plants consisted of 76-85% larvae, <0.1% pupae, and 10-28% adults. Although insecticide applications reduced thrips density, an average of 92 thrips was found on each onion plant over the season, which far exceeded the economic threshold. Several species of predators were found on onion plants.

Despite this, no model is available to describe its population dynamics and aid in its management. This paper describes a cohort-based model of the population dynamics of the Queensland fruit fly. The model is primarily driven by weather variables, and so can be used at any location where appropriate meteorological data are available. In the model, the life cycle is divided into a number of discreet stages to allow physiological processes to be defined as accurately as possible. Eggs develop and hatch into larvae, which develop into pupae, which emerge as either teneral females or males. Both females and males can enter reproductive and over-wintering life stages, and there is a trapped male life stage to allow model predictions to be compared with trap catch data. All development rates are temperature-dependent. Daily mortality rates are temperature-dependent, but may also be influenced by moisture, density of larvae in fruit, fruit suitability, and age. Eggs, larvae and pupae all have constant establishment mortalities, causing a defined proportion of individuals to die upon entering that life stage. Transfer from one immature stage to the next is based on physiological age. In the adult life stages, transfer between stages may require additional and/or alternative functions. Maximum fecundity is 1400 eggs per female per day, and maximum daily oviposition rate is 80 eggs/female per day. The actual number of eggs laid by a female on any given day is restricted by temperature, density of larva in fruit, suitability of fruit for oviposition, and female activity. Activity of reproductive females and males, which affects reproduction and trapping, decreases with rainfall. Trapping of reproductive males is determined by activity, temperature and the proportion of males in the active population. Limitations of the model are discussed. Despite these, the model provides a useful agreement with trap catch data, and allows key areas for future research to be identified. These critical gaps in the current state of knowledge exist despite over 50 years of research on this key pest. By explicitly attempting to model the population dynamics of this pest we have clearly identified the research areas that must be addressed before progress can be made in developing the model into an operational tool for the management of Queensland fruit fly.

J,"Nahrung, HF; Allen, GR",Overwintering ecology of Chrysophtharta agricola: mechanisms of reproductive diapause induction and termination,"Reproductive diapause is common in the Chrysomelidae, and allows 'escape in time' of conditions unfavourable for growth and development. Chrysophtharta agricola (Chapuis) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), which undergoes one or two generations per year, spends 7-8 months in reproductive diapause, emerging in spring to feed and oviposit. We manipulated photoperiod and temperature to test their effects on induction and termination of diapause in the laboratory; we also conducted field studies for validation of results, and to examine patterns of voltinism as determined by the onset of diapause. A critical photoperiod of between 12 and 16 h of light was required to initiate diapause in the laboratory and field, although 55% of beetles entered diapause in response to low temperature (9degreesC) alone. At short photoperiods (8L: 16D), high temperature (21degreesC) subverted diapause in 20% of adults. Therefore, voltinism in C. agricola is a seasonally plastic trait dependent on emergence time of teneral adults. Diapause termination was primarily influenced by temperature, although photoperiod had an effect at low temperatures. Beetles accumulated day-degrees (DD) during overwintering, with beetles collected later terminating diapause sooner than those collected earlier (total DD was similar). Diapause termination is, therefore, dependent on DD accumulation above the threshold temperature (6.7degreesC), rather than a specific environmental cue. Results are discussed in ecological and applied contexts, and provide the ability to predict the population phenology of C. agricola.

J,"Hansen, LM",Economic damage threshold model for pollen beetles (Meligethes aeneus F.) in spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops,"The pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.) is the most important pest in Danish oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops. The beetle can cause serious yield losses in both winter and spring oilseed rape crops, and for spring oilseed rape, more than 80% yield reduction can occur. Consequently, in most years, spring oilseed rape crops are treated with pesticides. In the period 1988-1997, 26 spring oilseed rape pesticide field trials were carried out. The pollen beetle infestation was expressed as beetle-days calculated as number of pollen beetles per plant per day and summarised from immigration until end of flowering. Damage caused by pollen beetles was calculated as the yield loss between treated and untreated plots and expressed as a per cent of treated plots. A multiple regression approach was taken, in which the yield loss (YL) was the response variable and beetle-days (131), day degrees (DD) and precipitation before and after immigration of pollen beetles into the spring oilseed rape fields (P), were the independent variables. The highest value of the regression coefficient and the smallest sum of squared residuals was obtained in a model with only four variables included. The variables were beetle-days, day degrees (DD7b) and precipitation (P-7b) in 7 days before the start of immigration and day degrees (DD7a) in 7 days after the start of immigration. The model can be written as YL = 0.25313D + 0.340DD(7b)-1.721P(7b)-0.296DD(7a). (r = 0.76; p < 0.001; df = 139; F = 46.02). The economic damage threshold for control of pollen beetles in spring oilseed rape crops can be calculated as 5.0% of the yield. If temperatures are average, the economic damage threshold can be calculated as being from 0.1 to 3.0 pollen beetles per plant depending on the amount of precipitation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the present economic damage thresholds for spring oilseed rape in Denmark of between 0.5 and 1.0 pollen beetle per plant are too crude and must be more differentiated with reference to reducing the application index of insecticides.

The total food intake of larvae ranged from 24-65 mg, which is equivalent to up to 190 aphids. Larvae compensated for low food supply by reducing development rates, high prey exploitation efficiencies, reaching up to 100%, and by high prey-biomass conversion efficiencies, reaching over 40%.

Changes in broad mite population and seedling damage over time were measured after artificial mite infestations of seedlings with unfolded cotyledons, or with unfolded two, or four true leaves. With infestations occurring at these seedling developmental stages, symptoms of elongation and curling of apical leaves were observed five days after infestation. The mite populations first increased exponentially as days after seeding (DAS) increased and populations developed more rapidly in older seedlings that were infested. At 38 DAS (transplanting age, with 6 leaves unfolded in uninfested seedlings), seedling damage was greater in those infested at younger developmental stages. Mite population in seedlings infested at two and four leaves were still increasing at 38 DAS. Damage increased more rapidly with increased cumulative mite-days in seedlings infested at the cotyledonary stage. The relative growth loss caused by one mite-day was generally greatest shortly after infestation occurred. At 38 DAS, cotyledonary-infested and 2-leaf-infested seedlings showed necrosis in cotyledons and leaves while in 4-leaf-infested seedlings, symptoms of mite damage were just starting to be noticeable. This may indicate that transplants with no symptoms, which are a potential source of infestation in greenhouse-grown crops, become infested at the end of the transplant production cycle.

J,"Renault, D; Hervant, F; Vernon, P","Effect of food shortage and temperature on oxygen consumption in the lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera : Tenebrionidae)","Temperature and food availability are limiting factors for the establishment of tropical insects in temperate countries. In the alien pest beetle, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), starvation and temperature have a significant impact on metabolic rate with oxygen consumption ranging from 0.5 mumol/g fresh mass (FM)/h at 12degreesC to 3.4 mumol/g FM/h at 24degreesC. At 12degreesC, oxygen consumption decreased continuously during an entire period of starvation. However, at 16, 20 and 24degreesC, beetles display a marked hyperactivity that leads to an increase in the oxygen consumption level during the first week of starvation, followed by a steep decrease until the end of the starvation period. Oxygen consumption either does not decline in fed beetles (observed at higher temperatures) or declines at a much shallower rate than in starved beetles (observed at cooler temperatures). During the first week of refeeding, Oxygen consumption rose steeply at 16, 20 and 24degreesC before levelling off to the initial value (t(0)). At 12degreesC, no compensation process was observed during recovery. This study reveals that an important threshold in the biology of A. diaperinus lies between 12 and 16degreesC, leading to the onset of reduced locomotor activity and the promotion of survival to the detriment of reproduction. This 'sit and wait' behaviour is proposed as an adaptive strategy (i.e. inactivity and lower oxygen consumption coupled with low energetic requirements and high recovery abilities). Such behaviour and the observed hyperactivity were rarely described in insects before the present study. Together, the previous and present results suggest that A. diaperinus populations are likely maintained in temperate regions by immigration from warmer situations.",yes,experimental,laboratory,metabolism,,PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0307-6962,NA,2003,10.1111/j.1365-3032.2003.00338.x,WOS:000187256800003

J,"De Graaf, J; Schoeman, AS; Brandenburg, RL",Ecology and control of Neosorius brevipennis (Coleoptera : Staphymnidae) on turf grass in South Africa,"Very little information on the ecology and pest status of the fossorial rove beetle, Neosorius brevipennis Fagel is available (Smetana 1985). These beetles tunnel underground and lay their eggs in clusters of three to ten in the blind ends of tunnels. It was found by sampling and observation that N brevipennis were responsible for casting mounds on golf course putting greens in Johannesburg and Pretoria (Schoeman 1997). Soil castings may damage mowing equipment, interfere with play by deflecting putts, and are objectionable for aesthetic reasons. A study of a fossorial rove beetle (Osorius planifrons Leconte), responsible for casting mounds on greens at the Tucson Country Club, Tuscon, AZ, USA, was conducted in the late 1970s. That study included ecological and behavioral analysis and concluded that O. planifrons requires high soil moisture and probably feeds on soil microbes (Smith et al. 1978). The authors discussed cultural control but no chemical or biological control methods were addressed. The objectives of this study were to determine the annual population densities and soil profile distributions of N brevipennis on bent grass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) and kikuyu grass (Penisetum clandestinum Hochst. ex. Chiov.). The efficacy of chemical controls for N. brevipennis was also investigated. Neosorius brevipennis was sampled at the Wingate Park Country Club (WPCC) in Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa (25degrees44'S, 28degrees15'E). Chemical trials were conducted at Kensington golf course in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa (28degrees40'S, 25degrees10'E). The study was conducted from November 1999 to October 2000. Five random samples were taken with a putting green hole cutter (diameter: 110 mm and depth: 100 mm) on a green (bent grass) and on a fairway (kikuyu grass), respectively, to examine the distribution and population densities of adult and immature rove beetles in the soil profile. Eggs were not included in the study. Soil cores were examined in 25 mm thick sections and all stages found at each depth were recorded. The 10 samples were collected and analyzed monthly from November 1999 to October 2000 to determine the population density of N. brevipennis throughout the year. The distribution of N. brevipennis between the upper 50 mm. and 51-100 mm of the soil profile and between green (bent grass) and fairway (kikuyu grass) samples were compared using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Ten random plots of 0.25 m(2) (0.5 m x 0.5 m) were sampled to determine the mean number of casting mounds per 0.25 m(2). After assessments were made, 100 individual mounds were collected in poly-top-containers and the average dry mass per mound was measured in the laboratory with a Sartorius scale. Data were collected mid-day on putting green 9 at WPCC in mid April 2000, at an average surface temperature of 25.9degreesC. The chemical trials were conducted at the beginning of 2000 (8 January-3 March). The infested putting green 12 on Kensington golf course was divided into six blocks of 28 m(2) (3.00 m x 9.33 m). Five chemicals (carbaryl, fipronil, imidacloprid, isofenphos and azinphos-methyl), formulated as a WP, SC, SC, EC and EC, respectively, were tested. Blocks were randomly allocated to each chemical and a control (untreated) area. Insecticides were applied to the turf surface with a backpack sprayer at the typical turf rate (Table 1). Application was followed by irrigation (using the golf course irrigation system) for 9 min (equivalent of 10 mm precipitation) to water the insecticides into the soil. The control block was also watered with the same volume. The treated and untreated blocks were monitored weekly (at mid-day) for soil mounds or push-ups for eight consecutive weeks, starting 5 d after the single chemical application. Five randomly selected 0.11 m(2) (a circle with a diameter of 375 mm) areas in each block were used to count the number of soil mounds present each week (to test the temporal efficiency of the different chemicals).

These populations are isolated in high mountains, which tends to protect them from the attack of a severe defoliating Mediterranean pest, the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. However, as a consequence of climate change, the pine processionary caterpillar has increasingly attacked populations of this pine in recent years. This work describes the detrimental effects of defoliation by the pine processionary caterpillar in P. sylvestris subsp. nevadensis in Sierra Nevada. Defoliation strongly reduced pine growth as well as all the reproductive parameters measured (female and male cone production, mature cone size, seed production and seed weight), in addition to some deaths. If winter temperatures continue to increase; the pine processionary caterpillar will have a dangerous impact in these relict pine populations, by further reducing the pine's weak regeneration capacity.

This study was conducted to determine how 12 constant temperature regimes between 10-38 degreesC (+/-0.5 degreesC) may differentially affect the r(m) of the McDaniel spider mite, Tetranychus mcdanieli McGregor (Acarina: Tetranychidea), a common pest of raspberry, and its coccinellid predator, Stethorus punctillum Weise (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Tetranychus mcdanieli survived to maturity in the 14-36 degreesC range, compared to the 14-32 degreesC range for S. punctillum. Survival above 24 degreesC remained high for the spider mite, but decreased markedly for the coccinellid. Tetranychus mcdanieli's range for reproduction was similar to its survival range, but S. punctillum failed to reproduce at 14 degreesC and reproduced only poorly at 16 degreesC. Offspring production peaked at 24 degreesC for both T. mcdanieli (average 152 eggs per female), and S. punctillum (280 eggs per female). At all temperatures suitable for reproduction, female longevity of the coccinellid was greater than the spider mite, which was characterized by earlier/faster reproduction than the coccinellid. As temperature increased, the rm followed a typical asymmetrical dome-shape pattern, with maximum values of 0.196 d(-1) and 0.385 d(-1) at 30 degreesC and 34 degreesC, for S. punctillum and T. mcdanieli, respectively. For each species, the r(m)-temperature relation was successfully modelled using a curvilinear regression equation previously shown to predict development rate. In both species, the development rate response to temperature has a major influence on the temperature-r(m) relationship. In the 16-32 degreesC range suitable for population growth of both species, the r(m) of T. mcdanieli was 1.9 (30 degreesC) to 8 (16 degreesC) times greater than S. punctillum. These growth potential ratios are consistently in favor of the prey, suggesting a limitation of the coccinellid with respect to its capacity to track T. mcdanieli populations. However, under short season conditions, the inferior reproductive dynamics of S. punctillum's vs. spider mite prey should not have a prevailing influence in determining impact, and may be compensated by high voracity in combination with a strong aggregative response.",yes,experimental,laboratory,rm,,BIOCONTROL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1386-6141,NA,2003,10.1023/A:1021289832664,WOS:000179469600004

In addition, the same parameters were determined on Golden Delicious leaves at three constant temperatures (20, 30 and 35 degreesC, 65 +/- 10% RH and 16: 8 L: D) in the laboratory. A. viennensis showed a better performance on Golden Delicious than on the other apple cultivars. This was mainly due to a short development time (10.7 days), high daily egg production (5.2 eggs/female/day) and early reproduction peak. The highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) was determined on the variety Golden Delicious (r(m) = 0.247/day), while the lowest one was observed on the variety Starking Delicious (r(m) = 0.215/day). The developmental periods of A. viennensis varied from 7.4 to 18.8 days at 35 and 20 degreesC for females, while it varied from 7.9 to 17.2 days at 30 and 20 degreesC for males. The development threshold of the eggs and pre-adult stages were 9.72 and 9.07 degreesC, total effective temperature was 72.99 and 185.18 degree days, respectively.

We conducted this study to determine if life processes of populations of phylloxera from four different areas in the Pacific Northwest, USA, would show differences in survival, development and reproduction when reared at myriad of constant temperatures (3 - 36degreesC at 3degrees intervals). Individual differences were observed among the four populations for development, survival and reproduction. Nevertheless, the numbers for each parameter followed a general trend among temperatures. The optimum temperature range for maximum response for all parameters was between 24degreesC and 27degreesC. Upper and lower temperature thresholds were, respectively, <6degreesC and >33degreesC.

J,"Regniere, J; Nealis, V","Modelling seasonality of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera : Lymantriidae), to evaluate probability of its persistence in novel environments","The predictions of three published models of temperature-dependent egg hatch of the European strain of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L., were compared with observed hatch rates of caged egg masses in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Two of the three models gave a good fit to observations. Both of these models considered explicitly the period between oviposition in the summer of one year and hatch of neonates the following spring. When combined with models for temperature-dependent development of larvae and pupae, and adult longevity, the seasonal life history of an entire generation of gypsy moth could be simulated. These composite models predict the seasonal occurrence of all life stages of the insect. The simulated flight period of adult male gypsy moth on Vancouver Island in 1998 compared favourably with observed captures in pheromone traps. A series of gypsy moth generations was simulated using daily temperature inputs reconstructed from climatic normals (period 1961-1990) at various locations on the south coast and southern interior of British Columbia where gypsy moth has been frequently introduced but is not established. These simulations provided estimates of the probability of a persistent population resulting from a predicted stable seasonality of the gypsy moth. The highest probabilities of persistence were in coastal areas along the Strait of Georgia between Vancouver Island and the continental mainland and in southern interior valleys below approximately 500-m elevation (above sea level). Outside these regions, normal climatic profiles resulted in an unstable seasonality for gypsy moth with increasingly late oviposition dates, and subsequent problems in synchronizing initiation and completion of winter diapause with appropriate ambient conditions. The phenology models discussed here can be and were used as decision-support tools either to improve the efficiency of pest management operations (sampling, pesticide applications) or to make better decisions concerning the need for eradication of the gypsy moth in novel environments.",no,,,,,CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0008-347X,1918-3240,2002,10.4039/Ent134805-6,WOS:000179433600005

In 1996 results were reversed, and in 1997 viability was high with no difference among collection dates. A combination of infertility, weather extremes (temperature, humidity, or rainfall), or predation could explain the different percentage of desiccated eggs between the intervals when eggs were recovered.

Data did not show significant differences among the different soil depths at which adults were sampled, but there was an indication that adults move up in the soil in the spring prior to emergence.

Fields in their first year of production had lower levels of B. bassiana than fields in their second or third year of production, In 2002, these differences were not present. Linear regressions showed a positive but weak relationship between infection level and L. hesperus density in 2001. In 2002, a significant linear relationship existed between sample date and percentage infection suggesting a buildup of pathogen over time.

Average lifetime fecundity and preoviposition period was greatest at 15degreesC at 39.6 eggs per female and 17.6 days, respectively. jackknifed estimates of net reproduction (R(0)), capacity for increase (r(c)), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), and finite rate of increase (lambda) were all significantly greater at 20degreesC than corresponding values at 15, 25 and 27.5degreesC. Population doubling time (T(d)) was significantly lower at 20degreesC, indicating S. perseae populations can double 33-71% faster at this temperature in comparison to 15, 25 and 27.5degreesC. Mean adult longevity decreased with increasing temperature, from a maximum of 52.4 days at 15degreesC to a minimum of 2.4 days at 30degreesC. Developmental rates increased linearly with increasing temperatures for eggs and rates were non-linear for development of first and second instar larvae, propupae, pupae, and for egg to adult development. Linear regression and fitting of the modified Logan model to developmental rate data for egg to adult development estimated that 344.8 day degrees were required above a minimum threshold of 6.9degreesC to complete development. An upper developmental threshold was estimated at 37.6degreesC with an optimal temperature of 30.5degreesC for egg to adult development.

J,"Stacey, DA; Fellowes, MDE",Influence of temperature on pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera : Aphididae) resistance to natural enemy attack,"The ability to resist or avoid natural enemy attack is a critically important insect life history trait, yet little is understood of how these traits may be affected by temperature. This study investigated how different genotypes of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, a pest of leguminous crops, varied in resistance to three different natural enemies (a fungal pathogen, two species of parasitoid wasp and a coccinellid beetle), and whether expression of resistance was influenced by temperature. Substantial clonal variation in resistance to the three natural enemies was found. Temperature influenced the number of aphids succumbing to the fungal pathogen Erynia neoaphidis Remaudiere & Hermebert, with resistance increasing at higher temperatures (18 vs. 28degreesC). A temperature difference of 5degreesC (18 vs. 23degreesC) did not affect the ability of A. pisum to resist attack by the parasitoids Aphidius ervi Haliday and A. eadyi Stary Gonzalez & Hall. Escape behaviour from foraging coccinellid beetles (Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville) was not directly influenced by aphid clone or temperature (16 vs. 21degreesC). However, there were significant interactions between clone and temperature (while most clones did not respond to temperature, one was less likely to escape at 16degreesC), and between aphid clone and ladybird presence (some clones showed greater changes in escape behaviour in response to the presence of foraging coccinellids than others). Therefore, while larger temperature differences may alter interactions between Acyrthosiphon pisum and an entomopathogen, there is little evidence to suggest that smaller changes in temperature will alter pea aphid-natural enemy interactions.",no,,,,,BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0007-4853,1475-2670,2002,10.1079/BER2002173,WOS:000177120100011

This sawfly occurs in southern Mexico and Central America where it feeds on the foliage of Coccoloba spp. On Roatan Island, the only host is seagrape, C. uvifera, a small to medium tree, which occurs on sandy beaches just above tide line. The adults are colourful insects and relatively strong fliers. They swarm around host trees on warm, sunny days and during cool or overcast periods, rest on seagrape foliage and branches. In 2002, a period of peak adult activity occurred between January 8 and 10. Eggs are deposited in circular or slightly oval clusters on the undersides of seagrape leaves. Mean egg cluster size is 32.7, range 7-85. Female adults remain with the egg cluster until they die. Eggs hatch within two or three days of oviposition and the larvae feed gregariously on the edges of seagrape leaves, consuming all of the leaf tissue except the major veins. Larvae undergo six instars. However, the small number of instar VI larvae collected suggests that female larvae may undergo an extra instar, as is the case with other species of sawflies. Pupation occurs in parchment-like cocoons attached to leaves, leaf petioles and branches of seagrape. Occasionally, cocoons are attached to wooden surfaces such as picnic benches. A few instar VI larvae were seen with symptoms suggesting virus infection. While heavily infested trees can suffer complete defoliation, the insect appears to cause little or no permanent damage. Local residents regard the insect as a curiosity rather than a pest and report at least two periods of defoliation a year-January and August.",no,,,,,FORESTRY CHRONICLE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0015-7546,NA,2002,10.5558/tfc78515-4,WOS:000178344700010

On-site and near-site temperature data recorded every 30 min were obtained from portable recorders placed in selected fields, and regional data consisted of daily high and low temperatures recorded from weather stations located 1.5 to 16 km from the fields. For second instars, observed degree-days calculated from on-site and near-site data were associated with a 2-week period of highest occurrence of second instars. This observed degree-day window using on-site and near-site data overlapped with the expected degree-days for peak occurrence of the second instar (prediction based on a thermal summation model using a development-survival threshold of 10degreesC) in 9 of 10 fields. Similarly, the observed degree-day window, calculated from the regional data, overlapped with the expected peak occurrence at all 10 fields. For third and fourth instars, the overlap of observed and expected degree-days also was similar using the regional data and the on-site and near-site data. Initiating sampling at the beginning of the degree-day window for second instars, the regional data would have triggered sampling about 1 week earlier than when using the on-site and near-site data. In regard to initiating sampling after egg hatch and before occurrence of the more damaging large larvae, use of on-site, near-site, and regional temperature data were equally as valuable.

This study was conducted to characterize the temporal pattern of spring colonization of apple trees by overwintered weevils in relation to climatic conditions and apple bud stages, based on multiple mark-release-recapture experiments and field observations of foraging activities of weevils. The process of spring colonization of apple trees by overwintered weevils was related to thermal time totals above 0 degreesC. The dispersal into orchards initiated when the thermal time totals reached 161+/-27 (s.d.) degree-days (DD) calculated from January 1, or 117+/-16 DD from February 1. The daily dispersal speed of individual weevils within orchards was determined primarily by the maximum daily temperature, whereas crawling, feeding, and mating activities of weevils on apple trees were influenced by the mean evening temperature between 18:00 and 22:00 hours. On the other hand, the spring colonization of overwintered weevils was not synchronized with any specific apple bud stage, though the level of female foraging and reproductive activities on apple trees was related to apple bud stages.

The soil and air temperatures were used in a linear model of degree-day, determined for the insect under laboratory conditions. Thermal requirements for the development of D. speciosa were determined by the daily accumulation of thermal units (degree-day), starting from the base development temperature of the insect (11.04degreesC), using corn roots cultivated in pots as larvae diet. The value of the thermal constant (K) was used to predict insect occurrence, based on the mean temperatures of the soil and the air recorded during the experimental period. Regardless of the kind of temperature (air or soil) employed for the thermal requirements accounting, the accumulated degree-day values for the development of D. speciosa were significantly lower than the K value achieved in the laboratory.

J,"Todd, MC; Washington, R; Cheke, RA; Kniveton, D",Brown locust outbreaks and climate variability in southern Africa,"1. The brown locust Locustana pardalina is a major agricultural pest in southern Africa, with populations periodically reaching plague proportions. Management and control would benefit from a predictive capacity at seasonal time scales, as yet unavailable. 2. The results of a study into the dynamics and potential predictability of locust populations in southern Africa are presented here. The number of districts reporting locust control measures was used as a proxy for swarming brown locust populations. 3. Spectral analysis of the annual number of brown locust infestations over southern Africa revealed dominant periodicity at 17.3 years. The data were low-pass filtered and the low-frequency and high-frequency components were retained. The low-frequency component led the observed 18-year cycle in southern African rainfall by about 3 years, and was therefore likely to reflect endogenous controls on populations. 4. Variability in the interannual high-frequency component of brown locust infestations was strongly related to rainfall over the Karoo and Eastern Cape regions of South Africa. The highest correlations were with rainfall over the 12 months prior to the locust season (r = 0.64) and in particular with rainfall during December (r = 0.55). 5. Evidence is presented that the high-frequency component is related to the Pacific El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and that high-frequency locust activity is abnormally high (low) during La Nina (El Nino) events. 6. The high-frequency component of locust activity correlates positively and negatively, respectively, with sea-surface temperatures over the tropical western and eastern Pacific Ocean many months in advance of the locust season. Activity also correlates positively (negatively) with sea-surface temperatures over the south-west Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean (west and north-west Indian Ocean). These relationships occur later than those in the Pacific, developing in the austral winter and peaking in early summer. This pattern of correlations and the associated atmospheric circulation anomalies is consistent with ENSO-related and non-ENSO related patterns of climate variability. 7. The results suggest that there may be considerable scope for future development of models for the seasonal prediction of brown locust activity in which high-frequency variability is related to climatic indices.",yes,field,abundance,,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0021-8901,NA,2002,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00691.x,WOS:000174307300004

The life cycle of the psyllid was studied at three field sites in Co. Kerry. The psyllid exhibited a complex seasonal population dynamic suggesting that two, largely overlapping population cohorts over-winter as eggs and nymphs, respectively, in a state of reduced development or temporary dormancy. The duration of this dormancy is short. Evidence of a resumption of activity was monitored at all sites in early February with increasing adult numbers and renewed egg laying being seen before any significant rise in temperatures. This strongly suggests that retarded development, and resumption of psyllid activity in early spring, are at least partially consequences of the changing nutritional quality of the food plant, probably mediated by changing day length. As a consequence of seasonally inhibited development, individual egg and nymphal over-wintering cohorts probably alternate in the completion of two or three generations per growing season. Analysis of psyllid numbers on shoot samples showed that greater population densities were found on shoots at the top of the food plant compared with lower-placed shoots. Evidence was also found that the distribution of nymphal instars changed seasonally, probably in response to population density and increased competition for preferred feeding sites. Overall psyllid abundance, and the finer details of seasonal population dynamics, varied between plantations. In the absence of effective predation or parasitism by indigenous natural enemies, these differences were also likely to be due to variation in nutritional quality of the host plant and may be influenced by crop husbandry factors such as the timing and severity of crop pruning.",yes,field,abundance,,,ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0003-4746,NA,2002,10.1111/j.1744-7348.2002.tb00220.x,WOS:000180182100008
S,"Mehrnejad, MR","Bionomics of the common pistachio psylla, Agonoscena pistaciae, in Iran","The common pistachio psylla, Agonoscena pistaciae Burckhardt and Lauterer (Hemiptera: Psylloidea), is the key pest of cultivated pistachio trees, Pistacia vera (L.), and is distributed throughout all the pistachio-producing regions in Iran. This study focused on various features of the pest and was carried out both in the laboratory and the field under natural conditions. It was found that the common pistachio psylla has two seasonal forms. Clear morphological and physiological differences between the adult psyllid morphs were observed. However, both temperature and photoperiod strongly influenced diapause induction and termination in this insect. The optimum constant temperature for development was 30degreesC, however, the psyllid nymphs developed quickly, between 25 and 32.5degreesC. Both summer- and winter-forms of A. pistaciae are adapted to a wide temperature range for reproduction. Egg laying only started after mating and oviposition continued until death. This study indicated the important role of male psyllids in progeny production in the common pistachio psylla. In addition, several life-cycle parameters including thermal thresholds and constant, actual fecundity and intrinsic rate of natural increase for the psyllid were determined. In the Kerman province, the winter-form adult psyllids first emerged in early October and continued throughout the autumn until early December, emigrating towards the overwintering sites. Afterwards, the winter-forms appear in the pistachio orchards in the late winter and early spring and attack pistachio trees, feed on swollen buds, young leaves and shoots and establish the summer-form generation. Most first generation adult psyllids appeared around early May, when the founders' winter-form psyllid was still active on the pistachio trees. The pest population rapidly increases from early spring to late autumn. However, the presence of high population densities of psyllid nymphs and adults causes significant economic losses, particularly from the late spring to nearly the end of summer. The control of this pest relies almost exclusively on pesticides. However, the parasitoid wasp, Psyllaephagus pistaciae Ferriere, and the predatory ladybird, Oenopia conglobata (Linnaeaus), are the major biocontrol agents for this insect. The effects of other potential predators such as lacewing, ladybirds, mites, spiders and anthocorid bugs have not yet been fully investigated, but it is thought that these natural enemies all play a significant role in the control of the common pistachio psylla, particularly in the spring and autumn.",no,,,,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PISTACHIOS AND ALMONDS,NA,NA,3rd International Symposium on Pistachios and Almonds/12th Colloquium of the Group-Recherches-et-dEtudes-Mediterraneen-pour-le-Pistachier-et-lAmandier,"MAY 20-24, 2001","MEDITERRANEAN AGRON INST ZARAGOZA, ZARAGOZA, SPAIN","Serv Invest Agroalimentar Diputac Gen Aragon, Mediterranean Agron Inst Zaragoza, Asociac Interprofes Desarrollo Agrario, Int Soc Hort Sci, Soc Espanola Ciencias Horticolas, Estac Exptl Aula Dei",MEDITERRANEAN AGRON INST ZARAGOZA,NA,NA,,0567-7572,NA,2002,10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.82,WOS:000180267300082

The adult beetles invade the rice nurseries and the first direct-seeded fields Lit the beginning of the rainy season; they have a gregarious behaviour and their feeding activity, together with the mines bored by the larvae, determines a change of colour from green to pale yellow in the damage areas. which resemble outbreak areas of rice leafhoppers.

With increased use of mating disruption for codling moth control, outside sources of infestation have become more of a concern for growers using pheromone based mating disruption systems. Studies were designed to provide information on bins as a source of codling moth and the pattern of codling moth emergence from stacks of bins. In these studies, codling moth larvae colonized wood harvest bins at a much higher frequency than hai-vest bins made of injection molded plastic (189 moths emerged from wood compared with five from plastic). There was no statistical difference in the number of moths infesting bins that had been filled with infested fruit compared with bins left empty at harvest. This suggests that codling moth enter the bins during the time that the bins are in the orchard before harvest. Emergence of laboratory reared adult codling moth from wood bins placed in stacks was found to be prolonged compared with field populations. Temperature differences within the bin stacks accounted for this attenuated emergence pattern. Covering bin stacks with clear plastic accelerated codling moth development in the upper levels of the stack. Codling moth emergence patterns from plastic-covered stacks more closely coincided with male flight in field populations. This information could be important in developing a technique for neutralizing codling moth-infested bins, and in understanding how infested bins may influence pest management in fruit orchards that are located near bin piles.

Time to emergence at 20 degreesC for pupal samples transferred from outdoors late February through mid-March, in 1997 and 1998, was very similar, suggesting both diapause completion and minimal postdiapause development at this time. Linear and nonlinear models were fitted to postdiapause development rates at several constant temperatures (7, 11, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degreesC). The low temperature development threshold for the linear model was estimated at 4.7 degreesC, and the heat accumulation required for median emergence was 934.3 degree-days. Rate summation was initiated on 1 March, over 3 yr, and model predictions were validated with field emergence data. The linear model predicted emergence with an average error of <4 d of observed field emergence, for percentiles at and below the median, over a 3-yr period, compared with 4.0-5.4 d for the nonlinear biophysical model.

J,"Samson, PR",Effect of feeding by larvae of Inopus rubriceps (Diptera : Stratiomyidae) on development and growth of sugarcane,"Pot experiments were used to investigate the effect of root-feeding larvae of the soldier fly Inopus rubriceps (Macquart) on shoot production from sugarcane planting pieces (setts) and on growth and ratooning of sugarcane plants. Shoot elongation was inhibited while setts were exposed to larvae, and it resumed when larvae were removed. Infested setts produced a greater weight of roots than uninfested setts. Similar symptoms were induced by mechanical root pruning, suggesting that the effect of soldier fly larvae on setts may be a redirection of growth from the shoot to roots due to root damage. Larvae bad a greater effect on shoot production at lower temperature, particularly in cultivar 'Q151', which had a higher temperature threshold than 'CP44-101'. Temperature and cultivar may influence the harmful effect of soldier fly larvae on sett germination by changing the differential rates of plant growth and larval feeding. When growing plants were exposed to larvae, the infested plants were slightly smaller at harvest and subsequently produced many fewer ratoon shoots from underground buds than uninfested plants. Shoot elongation from buds was also inhibited in setts cut from the above-ground stalks of infested plants. Analysis of nutrient levels in plants did not indicate the mechanism for ratooning inhibition, because levels of the 10 elements analyzed were at least as high or higher in infested plants. Infestation was associated with an increased level of sucrose and a reduced level of fructose in stalks. The inhibitory effect of larval feeding on ratooning was not reversed when larvae were removed from pots 10 wk before harvest. However, new stubble produced from infested plants then ratooned normally after a second harvest, provided the new roots were not attacked. The symptoms of larval feeding in growing plants are unexplained, but may be caused by the prolonged withdrawal of sap from roots or the injection of some inhibitory substance by larvae.",no,,,,,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0022-0493,NA,2001,10.1603/0022-0493-94.5.1097,WOS:000171545000013

A negative exponential model was developed to dynamically predict survivorship throughout the overwintering months. Survivorship was modeled as a function of the number of days that weevils were in the habitat, negative degree-days (<0.0 degreesC), positive degree-days (>6.1 degreesC), rainfall, and mortality during the first month of overwintering. First month mortality was modeled as a function of overwintering survival potential of weevils determined by dissection examination of their body lipid content and gonad atrophy. A nonlinear iterative multiple regression analysis showed that the model explained 94% of the variability in parameterization-verification data; a goodness-of-fit test showed that 97% of the estimated survival values did not significantly depart from their corresponding observed values. With independent validation data 94% of the variability was explained by the survival model; a goodness-of-fit test for validation data showed that 96% of the predicted survival values did not significantly depart from their corresponding observed values.

The duration of the post-embryonic development from N1 to adult ranged between 35 and 38 days, independently of whether nymphs were reared at constant temperature or in cages with incandescent light bulbs that afford heat for thermo-regulation. In contrast, the number of nymphs reaching the adult stage was directly related to the power of the bulb from 0 to 60 W. The rearing density did not affect the survival and developmental time of nymphs over the range 100-400 nymphs per cage. The survival of D. maroccanus nymphs under optimal conditions, which were a 60 W bulb and 400 nymphs per cage, was around 60%. The mean number of egg-pods per female ranged between 2.6 and 3.5, and no difference was observed among rearing densities, with 16 pairs per cage being the optimal breeding condition. The number of eggs per egg pod ranged from 15 to 25, the egg viability from 20 to 50% and the adult longevity from 30 to 40 days.

The effect of weather on the size of British butterfly populations was studied using national weather records and the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS), a national database that has measured butterfly abundance since 1976. 2. Strong associations between weather and population fluctuations and trends were found in 28 of 31 species studied The main positive associations were with warm summer (especially June) temperature during the current and previous year, low rainfall in the current year and high rainfall in the previous year. Most bivoltine species benefited from warm June weather in the current year, three spring species and two that overwinter as adults benefited from warm weather in the previous summer, and most species with moist or semi-shaded habitats increased following high rainfall and cooler weather in the previous year. 3. Simple models incorporating weather variables and density effects were constructed for each species using the first 15 years' population data(1976-90) These fitted the observed data for that period well (median R-2 = 70%). Models were less good at predicting changes in abundance over the next 7 years (1991-97), although significant predictive success was obtained. 4. Parameter values of models were then adjusted to incorporate the full 22-year data-run For the eight species whose models had best predicted population changes or fitted the data well (R-2 > 85%), models were run from 1767 to 1997, using historical weather records, to 'predict' trends in abundance over the past two centuries. For three species it was possible to compare predicted past trends with contemporary accounts of abundance since 1800. In each case, the match between predictions and these qualitative assessments was good. 5. Models were also used to predict future changes in abundance, using three published scenarios for climate change.

J,"Onsager, JA",Suppression of grasshoppers in the Great Plains through grazing management,"It was hypothesized that grazing management could mitigate grasshopper outbreaks on native rangeland in the northern Great Plains. Key practices would require deliberate variation in timing and intensity of grazing events, preservation of canopy during critical periods of grasshopper development, and reductions in areas of bare soil. The twice-over rotational grazing system appeared compatible with those requirements. Grasshopper population trends were monitored during 1993-1995 and 1997-1998 on commercial native rangeland under twice-over rotational grazing vs traditional season-long grazing. A ubiquitous pest grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes (Fabricius), occurred at every sample site during each year in numbers sufficient to provide life history parameters for comparison between treatments. Under rotational grazing, the nymphs developed significantly slower and their stage-specific survival rates were significantly lower and less variable. Consequently, significantly fewer adults were produced significantly later in the season under rotational grazing. Seasonal presence of all grasshopper species combined averaged 3.3X higher under season-long grazing than under rotational grazing. Local outbreaks that generated 18 and 27 adult grasshoppers per m(2) under season-long grazing in 1997 and 1998, respectively, did not occur under rotational grazing. The outbreaks consumed 91% and 168%, respectively, as much forage as had been allocated for livestock, as opposed to 10% and 23%, respectively, under rotational grazing. Of 9 important grasshopper species, none were significantly more abundant at rotational sites than at season-long sites. Three species that were primary contributors to outbreaks under season-long grazing remained innocuous under rotational grazing.

Adult Lepidoptera were collected every 15 days with five light traps, and the number of individuals per morphospecies in each site was recorded. Lowest numbers of individuals were obtained in July (14.3 +/- 4.7 insects/trap) and highest numbers were obtained by late December (86.8 +/- 41.1 insects/trap). During the five-year period, 653 species of Lepidoptera were collected and the Geometridae Stenalcidia grosica, Glena unipennaria, and Oxydia vesulia were the most abundant species, The mean seasonal fluctuation of the first two species were positively correlated with the total Lepidoptera fluctuation (p < 0.01; r = 0.6; n = 98), unlike the third species (i.e. O. vesulia) which was poorly correlated with the total fluctuation (p = 0.05; r = 0.2; n = 98). Multiple regression models were developed to assess the relative importance of plant age and weather factors (temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall) affecting species richness and fluctuation of Lepidoptera populations. Plant age and average temperature were the main weather factors affecting species richness and abundance of total individuals and individuals of the species S. grosica. Older plants (six- to seven-years old) and lower temperatures (approximate to 18 degrees C) seem to favor species richness and hig her populations of Lepidoptera, especially S. grosica. Tn contrast, plant age and rainfall were the main factors affecting the fluctuation of G. unipennaria populations which presented higher incidence in older plants (six- to seven-years old) and higher rainfall (approximate to 400 mm), We were unable to develop robust models for fluctuation of O. vesulia populations (r(2) < 0.15).

In order to evaluate the prospects of a classical control approach economically important major pests and their natural enemies were surveyed in three cabbage growing areas with distinct climatic regimes at low-, mid- and high-elevation. In the PNG highlands (Goroka and Tambul area, Western Highlands Province) the release and successful establishment of the P. xylostella-specific parasitoid Diadegma semiclausum (Hellen) reduced crop losses remarkably since 1995. Favourable circumstances, such as continuous brassica cultivation and low status of associated lepidopteran pests, particularly at Tambul (2400 m above sea level) with an almost temperature climate, were supportive for this approach. In the arid PNG lowlands (Laloki area, Central Province) the introduced P. xylostella-parasitoid Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjumov) exerted 80% parasitism in an experimental site, although a lasting establishment was not achieved in that location. Among several indigenous P. xylostella parasitoids Brachymeria phya (Walker) was a ubiquitous species but did not reduce the pest status of its host. Natural enemies of associated lepidoptera such as Crocidolomia pavonana (Zeller), Spodoptera litura (F.), Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) and Hellula undalis (F.) were economically insignificant. Thus, insecticidal control, preferably selective, was still a requirement. In comparison to Bacillus thuringinesis-products (Delfin(R) and Thuricide(R)) and the synthetic insect growth regulator Chlorfluazuron (Atabron(R)), best results were achieved in field trials with the commercial neem formulation NeemAzal(R) (Azadirachta indica A.

The phenological data thus obtained was used to examine the zero temperature threshold to model codling moth development. Two procedures were used to determine the base or zero development temperature for codling moth. They were the x-intercept, i.e., an extrapolation of the best-fit linear approximation of the reciprocal of time for development (days or hours) at each of a series of constant temperatures; and second using thermal units, i.e., physiological development time (degree-hours). The thermal unit was a constant at any logical rearing temperature when using the correct base (zero development) temperature. Physiological development time became increasingly curvilinear as the base temperature deviated from the correct value. Errors in base temperature, particularly at lower temperatures, introduce large errors into phenology models, reducing their reliability when used to time pest management procedures. Thermal units may be used to directly determine the base temperature or to validate the precision of the x-intercept. When reared at constant temperature, mean development time was 2,100, 6,100, and 5,800 degree-hours, but when reared under held-simulated (variable) temperatures the mean development time was reduced by 0, 500, and 1,100 degree-hours for eggs, larvae, and pupae, respectively. Development was retarded at 35 degrees C when reared at constant temperature, but not when reared at field-simulated temperatures that were as high as 35 degrees C for a few hours each day. There was no evidence for an upper temperature threshold using field-simulated temperatures. Modeling codling moth development in the field using field-simulated temperature data more accurately represents true development time.

The developmental rates of anatrepsis were studied at five constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 degrees C. Egg development occurred over the entire range but at 10 degrees C the embryos were unable to complete anatrepsis. The relationship between temperature and developmental times for completing anatrepsis was analysed by the non-linear Logan type III model. The optimal temperature estimated for the development of eggs during anatrepsis was 24.7 degrees C; the lower and upper thermal thresholds were 9 degrees C and 31 degrees C, respectively. Once the embryos completed anatrepsis, only those incubated at 15 degrees C continued morphogenesis beyond stage XIV (diapause stage) without a low-temperature exposure period.

We relate the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) to long-term light-trap catches of the two key moth pests of Australian agriculture, Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren) and H. armigera (Hubner), at Narrabri, New South Wales over 11 years, and for H. punctigera only at Turretfield, South Australia over 22 years. At Narrabri, the size of the first spring generation of both species was significantly correlated with the SOI in certain months, sometimes up to 15 months before the date of trapping. Differences in the SOI and SST between significant months were used to build composite variables in multiple regressions which gave fitted values of the trap catches to less than 25% of the observed values. The regressions suggested that useful forecasts of both species could be made 6-15 months ahead. The influence of the two weather variables on trap catches of H. punctigera at Turretfield were not as strong as at Narrabri, probably because the SOI was not as strongly related to rainfall in southern Australia as it is in eastern Australia. The best fits were again given by multiple regressions with SOI plus SST variables, to within 40% of the observed values. The reliability of both variables as predictors of moth numbers may be limited by the lack of stability in the SOI-rainfall correlation over the historical record. As no other data set is available to test the regressions, they can only be tested by future use.

In this context, resistant trees are those capable of delaying attacks rather than preventing attacks. This study investigated the patterns of survival times of resistant and susceptible trees in a progeny trial of white spruce in the interior of British Columbia, Canada. By doing so, we demonstrated that survival time analysis, a technique specifically developed for dealing with clinical medicine and industrial reliability tests, was a very useful approach in analyzing resistance of hosts to herbivore attack. The results suggested that survivorship of resistant trees was significantly different from that of susceptible trees, as expected. The median survival time of susceptible trees was similar to 12 yr after seeding, while it was 21 yr for resistant trees. The survival rimes of white spruce trees were identified adequately following a lognormal distribution. Based on the estimated hazard functions of the lognormal distribution, the most severe weevil infestation was predicted to occur at 19 yr for susceptible trees, and at 26 yr for resistant trees. infestation level was affected by several factors, such as tree height, seasonal temperature, and precipitation. An accelerated failure rime model was used to evaluate the effect of these factors on survivorship.

It was established that the colour of the environment has no effect on the number of the progeny. while the combined influence of the temperature and the light:dark period ratio is pronounced. Moderate environmental temperatures (13-20 degreesC) in combination with an about 1:1 light:dark period ratio favoured the highest number of the progeny of the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis Perg.).

In order to develop such a method, several parameters have to be determined first. The most important one is to determine the respiration rate of possible pest species. To obtain the data for establishing the method mentioned above, the respiration rates of the following species were determined: the old house borer, Hylotrupes hajulus, common furniture beetle, Anobium punctatum and subterranean termite, Reticulitermes lucifugus. We compared the O-2 consumption between different species as well as between adults and larvae of one species in different environmental conditions (temperature, day/night and light/dark regime). The most intensive respiration rates were found for the larvae of Hylotrupes hajulus (4.0 ml/g h O-2) and Anobium punctatum (3.9 ml/g h O-2). Less intensive breathing was measured by Reticulitermes lucifugus (workers 2.9 ml/g h, nymphs 2.6 ml/g.h and soldiers 2.0 ml/g h O-2). These results indicate that it is possible to detect the presence of wood-boring insects respirometrically. To detect the presence of an individual insect in the wood by means of respirometry, the sensitivity of the instrument for oxygen measurement at the optimal conditions must be around 0.2 ml/h.

The thermal constants, i.e., the mean developmental times in physiological time units, were found to be 342 day-degrees for females and 317 day-degrees for males, suggesting a slight protandry. Based on the mean and the variance of the developmental times, a simple temperature-driven phenology model was built using a time-varying distributed delay. The model was validated by visually comparing the predictions with independent observations on adult emergence, and by calculating the temporal deviations of the predictions. In 4 out of 5 years the mean error was less than 3 days.

Published equations describing the effects of temperature, humidity, and density effects on fecundity, juvenile survivorship and development and emigration were used or equations were estimated from published data and from laboratory experiments. Simulation model output was compared with S. zeamais density observed in field experiments before and after the introduction of Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) to West Africa. The overall phenology of the simulated beetle dynamics reflected that of field data, although the model output tended to overestimate beetle population growth early in the season.

The work reported here was carried out as part of a larger programme aimed at the classical biological control of the aphid in Africa. Basic life history attributes including life table statistics of the aphid were quantified in order to facilitate the development of efficient aphid culturing methods and essential baseline information necessary for the culturing of potential parasitoid biological agents prior to selection for introduction to Africa. Developmental rates and fecundity were studied under four constant temperatures (10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25 degrees C). The effects of several plant nutrients (nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus) supplied at different dose levels on life history attributes of Cinara sp. nov. were also studied. Unlike most other aphids, the apterous morph of Cinara sp. nov. developed through only three instars, and the alate four instars. The aphid is highly aggregative and exploits a wide range of feeding sites from young green branches to woody stems. The developmental period of Cinara sp. nov. ranged from 9.3 days at 25 degrees C to 22.3 days at 10 degrees C and the developmental threshold was 0.61 degrees C. Reproduction was delayed, because of the longer duration of development, and nymph production decreased with decreasing temperature. The intrinsic rate of increase ranged between 0.117 at 25 degrees C and 0.060 at 10 degrees C. Aphid size increased significantly as temperature was lowered. Wing formation was not induced when apterae were reared for up to three generations at each constant temperature but continuous crowding in the supply cultures held at 21 degrees C resulted in a high number of alates being formed.

Prediapause beetles were sampled for diapause readiness using a feeding-digging test. In 1994, a plot left unprotected from the beetle (moderately defoliated) was monitored. In 1995, movement around a plot left unprotected from the beetle (severely defoliated) was compared to that from a plot protected (only lightly defoliated) by inundative release of the potato beetle predator Perillus bioculatus Say (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Movement frequency by postdiapause beetles in spring 1995 was low compared with 1994 pre diapause movement, especially on the ground. Low-frequency flying persisted over several weeks of postdiapause beetle oviposition, with only a brief period of directionality. Flight movement by satiated prediapause beetles in August 1994 and 1995 was strongly directional, being oriented toward the closest forest border east of the plots, where sampling confirmed overwintering. In both years, satiated prediapause beetles also emigrated by walking, but mostly from densely populated and defoliated plots.

The mean fecundity of A. marina was 141 eggs. The generation time of this species was between 34 and 42 days, based on four generations, suggesting that the species has nine to 10 generations a year on Ball island where the temperatures are seasonally constant. When crawlers of A. marina were transferred to potted seedlings of R. mucronata, they settled on all leaves of the seedlings. Newly expanded leaves were not infested by the first generation crawlers but were attacked by the following generations. The insect attack induced browning of the leaves and finally caused leaf fall; the leaves fell 25-159 days after the crawler transfer. Consequently, the seedlings died on average 128 (range 82-159) days after infestation. This suggests that once a large number of crawlers attack R. mucronata seedlings, A. marina call kill them within several months. When crawlers were transferred to potted seedlings of three mangrove species (R. mucronata, Rhizophora apiculata Bl, and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza L.), which were the main species planted at the study site, the numbers that developed into adult females did not differ significantly among these species.

An appropriate monitoring for this polyphagous species to show a relationship between the kind of sampling or a model and the subsequent damage in a particular crop, is very difficult. Sex pheromone traps, generally, are also not reliable for monitoring ECB. The possibility of employing new types of traps baited with a sex pheromone and a maize kairomone, the phenylacetaldheyde (PAA) (multibaited traps) was investigated. In sweet corn, trapping experiments were conducted over a 2-year period with two kinds of cone traps (XLa and XLb) set up at the borders of fields (four replicates). ECB attacks of first and second generation larvae were evaluated in the corn ears as a percentage of damage and using a damage index (DI). A correlation was found between the number of females caught per trap and either the percentage of damaged ears (r = 0.73 for XLa; r = 0.65 for XLb) and the DI (r = 70 for XLa; r = 0.60 for XLb). Conversely, the number of males caught per trap was not correlated with ECB larval damage. A linear model of multiple correlation fitted to the data of simultaneous captures of males and females showed that the coefficients were not higher than simple correlation.

Helicoverpa armigera and T. capensana were monitored with light-traps and orchard scouting. In H. armigera the relationships between adult activity, oviposition on citrus blossoms, the presence of larvae on citrus trees and the correlation between moth activity and climatic factors were determined. A correlation between moth activity in autumn and pest status in the following spring was demonstrated. Although the oviposition levels on Navel blossoms were higher than on Valencia, both cultivars were subject to an oviposition peak in the first week of September. The larval population peaked on both cultivars in the third week of September during full bloom. Larvae appeared earlier on Navel and but persisted longer on Valencia. In a simple regression analysis, light-trap catches correlated with minimum and maximum temperatures, evaporation, and wind and saturation deficit. In a multiple regression analysis a positive correlation was demonstrated between minimum temperature and wind, and moth catches. The packhouse culling figure owing to damage by H. armigera damage for 1986-1993 was 0.43 % (S.D. = 0.27) for Navel and 0.29 % (S.D. = 0.25) for Valencia fruit. Tortrix capensana activity in winter and the following spring were correlated through light-trap catches. The adult population with the highest economic impact on citrus fruit quality occurred in the fourth week of September. Larvae produced by these moths appeared two weeks later. Subsequent moth generations between December and May were of no economic importance. In a simple regression analysis, light-trap catches showed the highest positive correlation with ambient temperature. In a multiple regression analysis evaporation and rainfall correlated positively with moth catches. The packhouse cull averaged 0.64 % (S.D. = 0.68 %) on Navels and 0.52 % (S.D. = 0.56 %) on Valencias. Lemons were not damaged.

Changes in developmental rates, which shorten or prolong the growing time may aggravate or reduce the effects of sub-optimal conditions on yield. Therefore, the effect of defoliation on development of cauliflower was investigated in a number of field experiments. Reduction in curd growth due to defoliation during the curd growth phase was compensated by an increased duration of curd growth. It was estimated that defoliation during curd induction corresponded to an increase in temperature sum requirement for curd induction of 15 to 25 degree days, while defoliation during curd growth increased the temperature sum requirement with 12 to 60 degree days Measurement of maturity by means of curd specific weight showed that defoliation delayed maturity. This implies that yield losses due to defoliation can to a large extend be avoided by postponing the harvest of curds.

It is generally accepted that this phenomenon is a consequence of the non-linearity inherent in the temperature-rate relationship of insect development and is known as the rate summation, or Kaufmann, effect. Some researchers invoke an additional physiological mechanism or specific adaptation to cycling temperatures resulting in a genuine alteration of development rate. Differences in development rates at constant and cycling temperatures may have important implications for degree-day (linear) population models, which are used in bath pest management and ecological studies.

Development rates under the alternating regimes used were found to differ from those under equivalent constant temperatures in a pattern suggestive of the Kaufmann effect: in all species development at 20/10 degrees C was faster than at 15 degrees C, and for three species development at 30/20 degrees C was slower than at 25 degrees C.

Survival and developmental rate on horse-nettle and potato were measured for larvae from both colonies over a range of constant temperatures ( 12-30 degrees C) and one fluctuating temperature regime (22 degrees C to 30 degrees C). The ability of Colorado potato beetles to use horse-nettle as a larval host was strongly influenced by temperature, but the effects of temperature differed greatly between beetles from the two colonies. Survival of adapted larvae on horse-nettle was highest and comparable to that on potato at the constant 30 degrees C and the fluctuating temperature regime. Below 30 degrees C, survival of adapted larvae decreased drastically but some larvae survived at all temperatures except the lowest (12 degrees C). In contrast, survival of unadapted larvae to adult occurred only at 30 degrees C, and was low (10%). At lower temperatures, all larvae died. On potato, the effect of temperature was less dramatic, and consistent across colonies. At 12 degrees C, survival to adult was poor(ca. 10%), but at higher temperatures, survival increased sharply and larvae from both colonies survived equally well. On potato, small but statistically significant differences in developmental rates between beetle colonies were detected at the constant but not at the fluctuating temperature regimes. Also, the developmental day degree requirements (DD) and the low temperature development threshold (TO) values for the various developmental stages did not differ between colonies on potato. On horse-nettle, development times for both colonies were always significantly longer and DD requirements were greater than on potato. At 30 degrees C, the only constant temperature at which larvae from the unadapted colony completed development, the development rate to adult emergence was similar to that of beetles from the adapted colony. Differences between colonies in performance on horse-nettle were not a result of host-independent, genetically based differences in the thermal requirements of the two populations. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptation to horse-nettle by Colorado potato beetle may be facilitated by a genotype x environment interaction involving temperature. These findings have important implications for host plant utilization, host range expansion and selection of pest biotypes adapted to plant resistance traits used in crop protection.",no,,,,,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0013-8703,1570-7458,1998,10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00407.x,WOS:000079723600007

Knowing the phenology of S. ocellana could improve timing of controls for this pest. Seasonal night activity of male, eyespotted bud moths was monitored using pheromone-baited traps hung in unsprayed apple (Malus pumila Mill.) orchards in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia from 1993 to 1996. Emergence of adult males and females and oviposition was monitored from 1994 to 1996 to establish relationships between their phenology and accumulated degree-days above 10 degrees C air temperature or number of days after the 1st moth was caught (biofix). Biofix occurred between 1-5 June, except in 1996, when it occurred 2-3 wk later, and night activity continued until late August. Males and females emerged on the same day, 2.0 +/- 1.7 d (mean +/- SD, n = 3 yr) before biofix, and oviposition began 4.3 +/- 1.5 d after biofix. The nonlinear relationship between cumulative trap catch and d or number of degree-days after biofix was modeled with cumulative Weibull functions. A model based on data from Summerland using days after biofix as the predictor variable was more accurate at predicting the interval between biofix and 50% cumulative trap catch for independent data sets from Kelowna and Winfield than a model using degree-days after biofix as the predictor variable. However, the use of degree-days as a predictor variable has wider application to other regions and years. Similar models were used to describe the relationship between days or degree-days after biofix and cumulative emergence of males, emergence of females, and oviposition, respectively.

Moth density significantly affected the performance of the different traps, with P traps being more effective at low than high density. However, P trap catches decreased just prior to the onset of female captures, probably as a result of competition between traps and virgin calling females. Nearly all females caught in L and LP traps were already mated and even the first females caught had laid at least half of their egg complement. In Quebec under warm nights, the pattern of male activity occurred at different times, with peak P catches being later in the scotophase than those of L traps, but overall similar numbers of males were caught in both traps. In contrast, under cool nights, males were caught early in the night in both P and L traps, suggesting a strong competition effect between traps, although more males were caught in P than L traps overall. In Newfoundland, the pattern of male captures in L and P traps was similar at both high and low temperatures, so competition between trap types would always be high. Under these conditions P traps were more effective than L traps. Irrespective of the region, year or temperature, significantly more males were captured in LP, with the effect of L and P being additive. In both regions, females responded similarly to L and LP traps with peak activity occurring early in the night. Captures of females were lower than those of males under cool temperatures, suggesting that the temperature threshold for flight is higher for females.

The study consisted of 2 types of survey as follows: (1) weekly monitoring of bollworm and tobacco budworm moths in Hardeman and Knox counties to investigate their long-term seasonal activity patterns, and (2) daily monitoring of bollworm moths in Haskell, Knox, and Wilbarger counties to quantify the effect of lunar cycles on moth generation cycles. Moths were active from early April to late October, with increasing activity as the growing season of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., progressed through September. Although the bollworm-budworm complex in the region consisted of approximate to 93% bollworms and only approximate to 7% tobacco budworms, the seasonal trends in activity patterns were similar for both species. Correlation analyses showed a significant positive relationship between weekly trap catch and temperatures, but a significant negative relationship was observed between trap catch and wind velocity for both species. Although the average monthly activity levels were positively correlated between adjacent months, there was no significant correlation between the activity of the moth population that contributed to the overwintering generation and the following spring population. Mean seasonal abundance curves, with upper confidence limits, were constructed for each species based on 15-yr averages. The mean abundance curves of this type are useful for identifying years with unusual moth severity. Daily trap catch data showed that the moon phase influenced the capture of bollworm moths in pheromone traps, as indicated by a significant positive correlation between trap catch and percentage moon illumination. Daily trap catch data also showed that the maximum trap catch occurred 71% of the time during the full moon, followed by Ist quarter (11%), last quarter (9%), and the new moon (9%).

An important management strategy is to apply an insecticide when the larvae move from the initial grass or broadleaf hosts to corn hosts. After the larvae bore into corn stalks, they are much more difficult to manage. Therefore, predicting the movement of larvae from weed hosts to corn hosts is crucial. This study was conducted to determine probable dates for stalk borer larval movement using climatic data from 67 locations across portions of South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana. We also examined the difference in probable dates of larval movement using the entire climate data record (60-90 yr) as opposed to using the 30-yr climatic normal record (1961-90). The minimum number of degree-days (780 Celsius degree-days 4.4 degrees C base temperature) in which larvae move from initial weed hosts to corn, were accumulated for each year in the climate record beginning 1 March and correlated with calendar dates. The mean date of larval movement in the in the states examined spans approximately 3 weeks, from 2 June in the southern portions to 23 June in the northern portions. Standard deviations about the mean date of larval movement were 5, 6, and 7 days in the southern, central, and northern portions, respectively.

These larvae had undergone an unknown but significant proportion of their development in the field. The method first models development rate as a function of temperature using relative growth rates in mean larval weight. Predicted mean larval weight was then used as a physiological time scale in an ordinal regression model of the proportion of the population in each of first to third-instar stage. An algorithm to predict proportions in the field of each stage up to and including the pupal stage given a known starting date for the population and daily maximum and minimum soil temperatures is described and tested using data from two field sites. Growth rates under laboratory conditions were slower than those in the field probably due to the handling required for weighing.

Larval development, pupation, whole cycle description and practical implications","Following the first part (FURLAN, 1996) dealing with adult behaviour and oviposition, this paper describes the larval and pupal development of Agriotes ustulatus Schaller. Larval size (head width and length) and weight of the 11-13 instars is defined. Larvae need live vegetable tissues to survive and grow. Most of the young larvae die within 30 days without live vegetable tissues while resistance to starvation increases with the age of the larvae. Each instar passes through three phases: mandible hardening and darkening, feeding, premoulting. The intense feeding and then the damaging phase lasts less than 20% of the total time. They are polyphagous and the rate of larval development does not vary according to the different crops supplied, nor did the kind of soil influence the number of instars and the rate of development. Provided with enough soil moisture, the rate of development strictly depends on soil temperature: the duration of each instar and pupae was studied at different temperatures. In laboratory conditions the centigrade degree day accumulation (CDDA) (above 10 degrees C) required to complete the whole cycle ranged between 3700 and 4500 (average 4156). In the rearing cages and in the open field this data was confirmed and the whole cycle was completed in about 24 months. At the latitude of the region where this study was carried out (45 degrees 34'00 N-45 degrees 42'00 N) the seventh instar (which normally is the first instar passing 10 mm) is attained by June of the year subsequent to oviposition, while most of the larvae reached the last instars by November and pupated the following year. Pupae can be found between the end of May and September mostly in the upper soil layer. The duration of the pupal stage lasts 13 days at 20 degrees C.

Nearly 80% of the trajectories were constructed in the prevailing Winter Monsoon and Trade winds, resulting in a southward displacement of insects towards putative overwintering areas as reported in previous studies. Tropical cyclones in autumn, produced trajectories which differed in both direction and extent from those in the prevailing winds, supporting the suggestion that the contraction of the distribution areas of rice pests at this time of year is the product of a series of movements in different directions.

The captures of adult moths made with pheromone traps indicate the existence of two generations, the first one flying in May and the second one in July-August. The larvae of first generation of both species rarely attack maize, but by September, most plants have been colonized by S. nonagrioides and, in a lesser degree, by O. nubilalis larvae. Larvae of both species overwinter inside the dead plants of maize, that are usually left in the fields after harvesting by most farmers. Given the mild winter temperatures of the South Atlantic coast, most of them survive until the nest spring and produce the adults of first generation. Cultural methods (e.g. destruction of plant stems) and the use of resistant maize genotypes could improve the management of maize borers, diminishing their economic damages.",yes,field,abundance,,,MAYDICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0025-6153,NA,1998,NA,WOS:000073267400002

Populations of this aphid are highest in flax when the weather is warm and dry in July. Field-plot studies show that populations of the potato aphid increase rapidly in late July and early August and decline rapidly in mid-August. In some years potato aphids die because of a fungal epizootic or drought-induced senescence of the crop, but usually these factors do not account for the population decline. Field cage studies show that the potato aphid emigrates from the crop in mid-August. The photoperiodic response of the potato aphid and resulting emigration explain the population decline in flax, which occurs in mid-august each year regardless of the growth stage of the crop, population density, or average temperature at the time of the photoperiodic cue.

The total number of immature individuals per plant was assessed throughout the whole reproduction period during a 4-yr study. Two supplementary data sets were collected in 1994 and 1996. Total insect population density plotted against degree-days (in base 10) differed among years. The speed at which the population maximum was reached was steeper during wet years than during dry years. The hypothesis was that the differences in slopes were caused by drought stresses, which were known to influence egg laying from experiments in controlled conditions. A model based on the Weibull distribution and describing the growth of insect population density per plant from the beginning of egg laying to maximum density is proposed. The insect population density is expressed as the cumulative proportion of individuals found in plants, varying in the interval (0,1).

Exposure of eggs to incubation temperatures known to be optimal for Z. diniana elsewhere resulted in a pre-diapause mortality of 13% which corresponds to known rates of egg mortality in British forests. Evidence suggests that high temperature and its duration are both important determinants of pre-diapause egg mortality which, if experienced in forest conditions, may prevent populations from reaching outbreak levels. Historical records of outbreaks were associated with lower than average August temperature. However, high temperatures on their own are unlikely to determine the range of the insect in Britain since a high proportion of eggs survives extremes; more than 70% of British eggs survived 24 h exposure to a temperature of 30 degrees C. Variations in egg mortality among families of moths suggests a genetic basis for differences in thermal tolerance.

This biological trait is generally not considered important for population stability, except if the delay is very long, and hence it is ignored in most population dynamics studies. However, many crops have relatively short durations, and these time delays may have important consequences and cannot be ignored in a dynamics model. In this study, we are looking for the key-factors that influence an aphid-parasitoid system population dynamics during a cropping cycle. Specifically, a simple model based on ordinary and delay differential equations and including biologically meaningful parameters was developed fbr aphid-parasitoid systems and used to examine: (1) effect of biological characteristics of both the aphid and the parasitoid on their dynamics, (2) the effect of parasitoid augmentation on the dynamics of the system (e.g.: date, number and importance of the releases of parasitoids), and (3) to compare observed Aphis gossypii Lysiphlebus testaceipes dynamics in a cucumber crop to the predictions of the model.

Nearly 50% of the trajectories were constructed in mobile weather systems which both disturbed and strengthened the prevailing winds and led to pronounced differences in the direction and distance of sources for insects caught at any catching site. Similarly, fluctuations in position of quasi-stationary fronts induced considerable mixing of populations from different sources and influenced the northern extent of each phase of rice pest migration.

GTLAUS is not a prediction model for practical plant protection, bur a tool for analysis of the interaction of different pest and antagonist densities and ecological effects of changing climate and other environmental conditions. The model contains three submodels: wheat ontogenesis, popular-ion dynamics of the cereal aphid Sitobion avenae (FABR.), and population dynamics and predation of aphid-specific predators, especially Coccinella septempunctata L. Several functions for certain features, e.g. grain yield loss and aphid mortality due to parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi, were also incorporated into the model. A large number of scenario runs with various initial population densities and different weather regimes were analyzed to quantify aphid population development under certain conditions and antagonist potential for natural control. Age structure variation in the initial aphid population leads to markable differences in population growth race. Temperatures 3K higher than the long-term German mean temperature were found to give especially C. septempunctata a relative predatory advantage compared with aphid multiplication. Natural control, therefore, increases even clearly so. The model calculations also showed that the impact of beneficials varies greatly, depending primarily on aphid density and temperature. Lower temperatures may favour aphids for seasons of prolonged wheat ripening and weaker predator activity.",no,,,,,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENKRANKHEITEN UND PFLANZENSCHUTZ-JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0340-8159,NA,1996,NA,WOS:A1996VV72600013

Plants were either maintained as uninfested controls, or were exposed throughout the growing season to different insect densities that mimicked the natural seasonal pattern of infestation. In 1984, a trial was conducted using cv. 'Norland' exposed to four different densities of potato flea beetles. In 1989 and 1990, cv. 'Russet Burbank' was exposed to potato flea beetles, and in some treatments, plants were exposed to early summer infestations of Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). In each trial, during the late summer period of high potato flea beetle density, the amount and distribution of flea beetle feeding injury were assessed at weekly intervals. Counts of feeding punctures in single leaflets were made from leaves in the upper, middle, and lower third of each caged plant, and these data were subjected to repeated measures analysis of variance. In each of the 3 years, increasing the number of flea beetles increased the mean number of feeding punctures per leaflet in an approximately linear fashion; however, the number of punctures per beetle varied between cultivars and years. In 1984 and 1990, the number of feeding punctures per leaflet was least in the upper third of the plants, and greater in the lower, or middle and lower, third of plants. However, in 1989, the vertical distribution of feeding punctures was relatively even. Previous feeding by Colorado potato beetles increased the mean number of flea beetle feeding punctures per leaflet and changed the vertical distribution of feeding punctures. Rainfall and temperature were correlated with patterns of flea beetle injury; injury was concentrated on lower leaflets during weeks of greater rainfall, and upper leaflets were injured most during weeks with higher average temperatures. It is concluded that flea beetles exhibit preferences for feeding in specific portions of potato plants, and that these preferences change in response to previous defoliation and are influenced by meteorological conditions.

J,"Nonhebel, S",Effects of temperature rise and increase in CO2 concentration on simulated wheat yields in Europe,"A crop-growth-simulation model based on SUCROS87 was used to study effects of temperature rise and increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration on wheat yields in several regions in Europe. The model simulated potential and water-limited crop production (growth with ample supply of nutrients and in the absence of damage by pests, diseases and weeds). Historic daily weather data from 13 sites in Western Europe were used as starting point. For potential production (optimal water) a 3 degrees C temperature rise led to a yield decline due to a shortening of the growing period on all locations. Doubling of the CO2 concentration caused an increase in yield of 40% due to higher assimilation rates. It was found that effects of higher temperature and higher CO2 concentration were nearly additive and the combination of both led to a yield increase of 1-2 ton ha(-1). A very small CO2-temperature interaction was found: the effect of doubled CO2 concentration on crop yield was larger at higher temperatures. The inter-annual yield variability was hardly affected. When water was Limiting crop-production effects of temperature rise and higher CO2 levels were different than for the potential production. Rise in temperature led to a smaller yield reduction, doubled CO2 concentration to a larger yield increase and combination of both led to a large yield increase (3 ton ha(-1)) in comparison with yields simulated for the present situation. Both rise in temperature and increase in the CO2 concentration reduced water requirements of the crop. Water shortages became smaller, leading to a reduction in inter-annual variability. It is concluded that when no major changes in precipitation pattern occur a climate change will not affect wheat yields since negative effects of higher temperatures are compensated by positive effects of CO2 enrichment.",no,,,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0165-0009,NA,1996,10.1007/BF00139254,WOS:A1996VL02600003

Because soil conditions, topography, and climate differ from the Midwest cent belt, questions arose as to the validity of previously published phenology models. Our study evaluated larval occurrence and adult emergence of western and northern corn rootworm, D. barberi Smith & Lawrence, in 11 fields in central New York during 1991 (2 fields), 1992 (3 fields), and 1993 (6 fields). Logistic regression models predicted cumulative occurrence/emergence from Julian date or degree-day accumulations calculated from either soil (base 11 degrees C) or air temperatures. Air temperature degree-days were calculated for minimum thresholds ranging from 1-16 degrees C. Additional threshold accumulations were determined by varying the maximum developmental threshold from 1 degrees C above the lower threshold to 30 degrees C. Minimum thresholds in the latter series of calculations were set equal to 4, 6, 9, and 11 degrees C. Julian date was a relatively poor predictor of all immature and adult stages. However, accuracy of air temperature models was dependent on choice of thresholds. The best fitting air temperature models either used minimum developmental thresholds near 6 degrees C for immature stages and 1-2 degrees C for adult emergence or calculated degree-days using a minimum threshold of 11 degrees C and a maximum threshold of 18 degrees C. Both soil and air temperature models indicated regional differences in immature development and adult emergence.

For each location, good, normal, and poor storage years were identified and evaluated. No aeration was found to be ineffective and undesirable for control of dry matter loss and S. zeamais development in all situations.

However, Indianapolis showed the least benefit compared to ambient fall aeration, while Columbia benefited most. Although only continuous ambient fall aeration was investigated, the results showed that controlling the aeration process holds promise in optimizing this technique, The use of spring warm-up aeration increased the rate of quality deterioration while summer rechilling improved insect control with little increase in dry matter loss. A combination of controlled ambient aeration in the fall and chilled aeration during summer storage has significant potential as a non-chemical preventative pest management technique for an locations and years.

J,"Willmer, PG; Hughes, JP; Woodford, JAT; Gordon, SC",The effects of crop microclimate and associated physiological constraints on the seasonal and diurnal distribution patterns of raspberry beetle (Byturus tomentosus) on the host plant Rubus idaeus,"1. The occurrence of raspberry beetles (Byturus tomentosus) on the host plant Rubus idaeus is extremely variable between seasons, between days and within days, with occupancy of the available raspberry flowers (the feeding and oviposition sites) varying from 0 to 60%. 2. This variation could not be explained by plant chemistry or food quality (leaf nitrogen, carbon or water levels, or floral nectar reward); however, beetle distributions were in part attributable to microclimatic constraints acting via the insects' physiological constraints. 3. Initial ascent into raspberry canes from soil emergence sites was limited by the three-fold higher water loss rates from recently eclosed young adult beetles as compared with mature beetles. Young adults reduced their hygric stress by remaining in the humid microclimate of tightly furled primocane leaftips. 4. Mature beetles spread upwards over the plant, but showed a preference for insolated sites (tops of canes, east or west facing according to time of day). In such sites their body temperatures could rise above the threshold for flight (requiring a T-b of 15 degrees C in laboratory studies). Flight activity was therefore common only in the early afternoon of warm days. Later in the day, beetles moved down and sometimes off the plants, starting to return at around dawn. 5. Thus physiological constraints, even on adult beetles (relatively well-protected insect stadia), can be important components in predicting insect movements and locations on a host plant; they are likely to be even more crucial to less highly sclerotized plant-feeding adult insects and many larval herbivorous pests.",no,,,,,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0307-6946,NA,1996,10.1111/j.1365-2311.1996.tb00270.x,WOS:A1996TU92000012

A biophysical model was found satisfactory to describe the temperature response of developmental and mortality rates of egg and nymphal stages, with a peak developmental rate around 34 degrees C in both species. The variability in development times was small and the experimental data did not permit any conclusion with regard to the Erlang probability density function. Survival of eggs and nymphs remained high between 20 degrees and 30 degrees C for both species. At temperatures above 34 degrees C, C. tomentosicollis survivorship and fecundity was higher than that of C. shadabi, which in turn laid more eggs at temperatures between 20 degrees and 30 degrees C.

In first-level blocks, insecticides were used throughout the growing season. In second-level blocks, no insecticides were sprayed after early June. Among the 12 orchards, 92% contained Amblyseius fallacis, 8% contained Typhlodromus pyri and 50% contained Zetzellia mali as predaceous species, while 100% contained Panonychus ulmi and 58% contained Tetranychus urticae as pest species. When averaged over the entire season, populations of predaceous A. fallacis and Z. mali and populations of pest P. ulmi were numerically, but not statistically, greater in second-level blocks than in first-level blocks. The opposite was true for T. urticae. Initial time of appearance of each species was about the same in both types of blocks. Panonychus ulmi peaked in mid-July, much earlier than A. fallacis, the most frequently observed predaceous mite. Populations of the latter peaked in September at relatively low densities, too late in the growing season for this species to provide, by itself, timely biological control of pest mites. Winter mortality from cold temperatures and spring/summer mortality from the use of fungicides are suspected to be the principal agents responsible for the slow build-up of A. fallacis. Zetzellia mali was present in early spring and increased slowly until reaching peak levels in autumn.

Captures rates were highest in the months of April, May and June, which corresponds to the onset of warmer weather in Egypt.

This hypothesis was investigated by assessing the performance of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), an important pest on Crucifers, on the crop plant oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Aphid growth and reproduction was measured at three controlled air temperatures and four watering regimes to induce water deficits. Plant nutritional quality (soluble nitrogen) and microclimate (leaf temperature), both important for aphid growth and reproduction, were determined. With increasing water deficit both soluble nitrogen content (% dry weight) and leaf temperature (degrees C) increased. At all three temperatures development time of the aphid to reproductive age was faster with increasing plant water deficits. Mean relative growth rates and the intrinsic rate of natural increase significantly increased with increasing water deficit at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, and 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees C respectively. Air temperature, leaf temperature, and soluble nitrogen are important factors on aphid growth and reproduction.

This technique uses historical climate data from various locations to calculate the median date a degree-day accumulation has been reached. ClimProb 3.1, a computer software program and weather database, was used to assess these correlations. We used 165 locations in 12 midwestern states for the analysis. Sixty years (1931-1990) of continuous daily climate data (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and liquid precipitation) were used for each location. We began degree-day accumulations on 1 January of each year and used a minimum developmental threshold of 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F). Degree-day accumulations were determined using a sine-wave method. The relationship between the date when the accumulated degree-days reached a threshold and the location (expressed as degrees north latitude) was quadratic from 36 degrees N to 48 degrees N. The technique gives approximate dates when egg hatch is likely to occur throughout the north central United States, and these dales can be used to augment existing decision criteria for initiating sampling programs for alfalfa weevil.

In growth chamber experiments, nymphs reared at photoperiods of <13.5:10.5 (L:D) h entered reproductive diapause. Egg production and proportions of gravid females in field populations dropped sharply between 1 and 15 August in both the warm (1991) and cool (1992) growing seasons, suggesting that the onset of reproductive diapause occurs in late July to early August. Stage-specific developmental times from a 1912 study of 118 leafhopper nymphs were used to estimate degree-day requirements (base 10 degrees C) for eggs and the 5 nymphal stadia. These estimates were used to construct a stage-specific developmental model, which was validated with field data collected at 4 vineyards in 1991 and 1992. The model predictions agreed well with the timing of developmental events in 4 vineyards in both 1991 and 1992, years representing extremes in temperature accumulations in western and central New York. These data suggest that accumulations of >710 degree days (DD) before 1 August are required to produce a 2nd generation of E. comes under climatic conditions in New York. Variations in temperature-driven development are hypothesized to strongly influence year-to-year variability in leafhopper abundance.

Net reproductive rate was the highest because of greatest survival and highest egg production when thrips were reared at 26 degrees C on winter melon, Benincasa hispida (Thunb.) Cogn., eggplant, Solanum melongena L., and cucumber, Cucumis sativus L., compared with bell pepper. However, because of shorter development time, the intrinsic rates of natural increase for T. palmi were highest when individuals were reared at 32 degrees C on these 3 host plants. Although development times were similar on all 4 hosts at 26 degrees C, survival and reproduction were much lower for thrips reared on bell pepper, Capsicum annuum L., leaves. At 15 and 32 degrees C, these differences were even greater, with only 40 and 48% of thrips reared on bell pepper surviving at the respective temperatures. T. palmi was able to tolerate the low temperature (56% mortality when held at 0 degrees C for 15 h) much better than the high temperature (100% mortality at 40 degrees C for 15 h), which may partially explain why T. palmi populations are high in winter and spring and low in the summer in Florida.

In the laboratory, large and small moths were produced during immature stages at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. These moths were then used to evaluate longevity, age-specific flight ability, flight ability of mated and unmated females, and the influence of flight experience on the subsequent reproductive success. The large moths lived longer and displayed a greater flight ability over 3 weeks. Irrespective of body size, unmated females flew for a longer time than mated females, and flight experience affected their subsequent reproductive success. Females of both sizes mated and laid eggs soon after emergence, without any obvious pre-reproductive period. More flight experience did not delay oviposition, but did reduce egg production. It is likely that large moths with a longer adult life span and greater flight ability are better fitted for long-distance flight and more fecund than small ones. These experimental results may explain why long-distance migration of P. xylostella is mostly seen during cool seasons, when relatively large moths with long forewing appear in the field.",no,,,,,RESEARCHES ON POPULATION ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0034-5466,NA,1995,10.1007/BF02515829,WOS:A1995UG77800016

To explain this synchrony, we investigated the Moran effect, a hypothesis that local population oscillations, which result from similar density-dependent mechanisms operating at time lags, may be synchronized over wide areas by exposure to common weather patterns. We also investigated the thee of climatic release, which postulates that outbreaks are triggered by climatic factors favorable for population growth. Tune series analysis revealed defoliation series in 2 states as Ist-order autoregressive processes and the other 2 as periodic 2nd-order autoregressive processes. Defoliation residuals series computed using the autoregressive models for each state were cross correlated with series of weather variables recorded in the respective states. The weather variables significantly correlated with defoliation residuals in all 4 states were minimum temperature and precipitation in mid-December in the same gypsy moth generation and minimum temperature in mid- to late July of the previous generation. These weather variables also were correlated strongly among the 4 states. The analyses support the predictions of the Moran effect and suggest that common weather may synchronize local populations so as to produce pest outbreaks over wide areas.

The young instars (1st and 2nd) fed in clusters and skeletonized the leaves, while the mature larvae were solitary and fed by making large openings usually along the leaf veins. Infestation with five to ten 2nd instar larvae per plant, at six weeks after planting, caused increases in the yield of sweet potato foliage over those of the controls, but these were not significantly different (P > 0.05). This was due to a compensatory response by the plants to the insect damage. The highest population of 20 larvae depressed foliage yields by 20.0 to 37.3% as compared with the controls.

Reproduction periods did not differ among temperatures, but at 25 and 30 degrees C more nymphs were produced (65.9 and 69.8 nymphs/female, respectively) than at 20 degrees C (59,9 nymphs/female) because of a higher daily reproduction.

Maps of defoliation frequency were assembled using historical aerial reconnaissance data. Maps of monthly means of daily temperature maxima and minima and of monthly precipitation averaged over 30 years were developed using an interpolation technique. All maps were at a spatial resolution of 2 x 2 km. Relationships between defoliation status and the environmental variables were modelled using a linear discriminant function. Five climatic change scenarios were investigated: an increase of 2 degrees C, a 2 degrees increase with an increase of 0.5 mm per day in precipitation, a 2 degrees C increase with an equivalent decrease in precipitation, and equilibrium projections of temperature and precipitation by two general circulation models (GCMs) at doubled CO2. With an increase in temperature alone, the projected defoliated area decreased relative to ambient conditions for the budworm and increased slightly for the gypsy moth. With an increase in temperature and precipitation the defoliated area increased for both species. Conversely, the defoliated area decreased for both when temperature increased and precipitation decreased. Results for the GCM scenarios contrasted sharply.

Fifty-four traps were installed 2.1 km apart in a line 122 km long from near Skene, MS, in Bolivar Co., southward to Onward in Sharkey Co. Traps were baited with sex pheromone to lure male moths to the traps. Moth captures were recorded twice weekly. Wings on a majority of moths caught from 7 April to 30 June were covered with nearly a full complement of scales indicating that they did not fly great distances before they were captured. These moths could have emerged from pupae that overwintered in soil of fields or ditches near the traps. Catches of moths in April ranged from 0.13 to 1.6 per trap per night. These relatively low capture levels also indicated that the beet armyworm moths were from a local source. There were four distinct peaks in numbers of moths caught between 1 July and 1 November, separated by 21 to 31 days. Highest numbers of moths (400/trap/night) were caught on 3 October. The shape of a peak in moth captures graphed for 29 July to 10 August, compared with sequences and amounts of rainfall prior to that period, indicated that many moths may have been carried to the region by storm fronts from the south and deposited in cotton fields during rain storms. Captures were sharply reduced on nights in April, September, October, and November when air temperatures dropped below 48 degrees F. In 1994, cotton developed about two weeks earlier than in 1993.

In this study, we investigate thermal effects on feeding, digestion, and net energy intake for Melanoplus bivittatus, the two-striped grasshopper In the field, M, bivittatus maintained body temperatures (T-b's) between 32 degrees C and 38 degrees C throughout most of a sunny day, but T-b's dropped to 0 degrees -15 degrees C at night. The threshold T-b for feeding in the field was 25 degrees C but was 15 degrees C when grasshoppers were kept without food for 12 h at 35 degrees C. Variables determined by the ability of the digestive tract to process food (food intake and fecal production per 8 h) were more temperature sensitive (Q(10)'s of 4-5) than variables reflecting chewing and crop-filling rates (Q(10)'s of 2-2.5). Higher T-b strongly increases net energy intake primarily by increasing digestive tract throughput in M. bivittatus, augmenting rates of individual development opment, and population expansion. The grasshopper's digestive system was essentially nonfunctional during half of its normal day in the field, implying that adaptation to high T-b's constrains digestive function at low T-b's.",yes,experimental,laboratory,consumption,,PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0031-935X,NA,1995,10.1086/physzool.68.3.30163779,WOS:A1995QY75200006

The source of infestation is perennial legumes. We followed the life cycle of the pea aphid from egg overwintering sites in leys of alfalfa, Medicago sativa (L.), and clover, Trifolium pratense (L.), to the infestations on peas, Pisum sativum (L.). Survival of overwintering eggs in the field was approximately 20%. Development of fundatrix to reproductive stage took 134 day-degrees (DD) above a threshold of 5 degrees C. Average total fundatrix fecundity was 52.04 nymphs. Because a considerable proportion of fundatrix offspring are alatae, these are probably an important source of first emigrants to the peas. Taking into account the low overall densities of these migrants, we found it impossible, using suction traps, to detect the timing or amount of migration to the peas early in the season. Catches in suction traps coincided with maximum alate production in peas, otherwise few pea aphids were caught in traps. Population development was best described using accumulation of day-degrees in the field. The intrinsic rate of increase per DD in peas was 0.01547 (SE 0.0007295, r(2) = 0.88) which is a common estimate for all years and locations. Peak occurrence in peas occurred at about 700 DD. Our studies show that it is virtually impossible to predict size of migration and therefore a general forecast of pea aphid levels in peas is impracticable. However, prediction of the timing of aphid population development is feasible.

Cockroach abundance, estimated by three monthly mean trap catches at each home, was correlated with habitat. After preliminary analysis, only 11 of the house and landscape characteristics were retained in the model. No characteristics dominated the description of habitat (an index) but some contributed positively and others negatively. The characteristics having the largest standardized weights in the habitat index were percentage of lot occupied by home, tree density, number of pets, number of residents, chemical pest control, age of house, and obvious cockroach harborages on the property. Unbiased estimates of variables weights of the habitat index obtained by the Jackknife method demonstrated the fit of the model and revealed minimal effect of outliers; of 14 weights, 11 had standard deviations <20% of the mean. We predicted that cumulative cockroach abundance would increase linearly with cockroach habitat index.

The preoviposition period lasted 118 hours, and most oviposition occurred between 12:00 and 20:00 hours, with a peak between 14:00 and 18:00 hours. Oviposition took place between seven to twelve days after emergence of adult. Eggs were laid singly mostly on leaves and only on soybean plants having pods. Daily removal of eggs from soybean plants resulted in insects laying three times as many eggs as when none were removed. The durations of egg incubation and each nymphal stadium decreased proportionately as temperature increased from 20 degrees C to 35 degrees C. At 20 degrees C durations of egg incubation and nymphal stadia were 12.75 and 35.47 days, respectively, whereas at 35 degrees C, these periods were 4.13 and 11.52 days, respectively.

Borer populations built up in broods 3, 4 and 5 in flooded deepwater rice to reach densities of 16-52 immatures m-2, which damaged 33-80% of the stems. Borer populations declined in brood 6 at the end of the deepwater rice season, the larvae entering diapause in the field stubbles. The major factors regulating the populations were as follows: the incidence of weather extremes (temperatures > 34-degrees-C with relative humidity <70%) before flooding which are lethal to eggs and first instars; the presence of succulent, elongating stems which are favourable for larval penetration and development; the occurrence of rapid water rises (6-8 cm day-1) which drown the immature stages; the activity of natural enemies, particularly the complex of egg parasitoids, and spider and orthopteran predators; and the harvesting and threshing operations which kill many diapausing larvae in the stems. An early season population outbreak in 1977 was associated with exceptionally mild, wet weather; the highest population density and level of stem damage followed a late surge of flooding in 1980 that produced a second flush in elongating stems.

With an increase in temperature alone, the projected defoliated area decreased relative to ambient conditions for budworm and increased slightly for gypsy moth. With an increase in temperature and precipitation, defoliated area increased for both species. Conversely, defoliated area decreased for both when temperature increased and precipitation decreased. Results for the GCM scenarios contrasted sharply. For one GCM, defoliation by budworm was projected to cover Oregon completely, whereas no defoliation was projected by gypsy moth in Pennsylvania.

In order to calculate the threshold temperature, a model, which describes the dependency of the fecundity on the adult age and on temperature, is needed. The Maxima Function introduced in this paper is distinguished from other models because it consists of very few parameters. This Maxima Function has been reparametrized so that the new parameters achieve biological meanings. The reparametrization influences the choice of the secondary model describing the influence of temperature on the fecundity. I could use the O'Neill model, that is well established in literature. By using the modified Maxima Function, a very simple algorithm is set up to calculate the total number of progeny per female at different temperatures.

In the absence of inclement weather, flight toward an attractant source occurred throughout the day with an activity peak between 1300 and 1500 h. Cloud cover that reduced solar radiation below 0.6 Langleys (Ly)/min and wind velocity above 20 km/h markedly reduced flight activity. Average climatic conditions during the time of maximum attraction to baited traps were temperature of 25.5-degrees-C, little or no cloud cover with light intensity of 1.1 Ly/min, relative humidity of 59.4%, and wind of 12.9 km/h. Changes in weather from optimal conditions for flight of the beetle to those that inhibit flight can be abrupt and occur often on Terceira. The influence of meteorological factors on beetle behavior indicates that applications of microbial and conventional insecticides would be most effective if made during climatic conditions that encourage aggregations of beetles on host plants and at other attractive locations. Because conventional insecticidal applications against adult beetles appear to be of limited value on Terceira, the use of entomopathogenic fungi for the microbial control of P. japonica may provide a viable alternative for suppressing this pest. Metarhizium anisopliae, especially in combination with attractive traps, appears to offer good potential for control of P. japonica. A 4- to 5-day delay in onset of mortality of adult beetles that were exposed to a lethal concentration of M. anisopliae spores allows sufficient time for dissemination of the fungus by beetles. The infected adults could then serve to create new foci of infection for larval P. japonica.

The MBB model was integrated with a soybean crop model as part of the Indiana soybean system model (ISSM). Results indicated that the model was able to capture the essential aspects of pest dynamics. Life table statistics based on simulation results were close to observed values for laboratory conditions (simulated intrinsic rate of increase, r = 0.056 and observed r = 0.053) and under field conditions (simulated r = 0.011 and observed r = 0.015). Simulated MBB population patterns and peak values were in good agreement with observed data. Differences between simulated and observed population patterns of immature MBB stages were greater than that of adults. Incorporation of mortality due to individual rainstorms and other weather events, and effect of alternate hosts and movement (secondary influx, emigration, etc.) seem to be important for simulating soybean production in a specific field. The model was used to evaluate the effects of crop variety, planting dates, weather and insect influx patterns on soybean yield. Results from simulation experiments showed that 'Williams 82' variety was more susceptible to yield loss (up to 45%) from MBB infestations, than the earlier maturing 'Century 84' (up to 25% yield loss). This susceptibility is due to the coincidence of the vulnerable crop stage (pod-setting and seed-filling stages) with the occurrence of the peak populations of MBB stages which cause most of the damage. Late planting tends to mitigate this susceptibility. As the influx patterns determine the extent of yield loss, the timing and magnitude of insect influx should be detected and estimated using timely scouting of fields.",yes,experimental,laboratory,fecundity,,AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0308-521X,NA,1994,10.1016/0308-521X(94)90143-4,WOS:A1994NH94600004

In descending order of risk, fallow, potato, pea (mainly vining), sugar beet and oilseed rape are the main crops preceding wheat or barley which attract oviposition. A declining trend of egg populations observed over the study period may be associated with climatic changes as well as with the elimination of fallow in the rotation and the dramatic increase in the use of insecticides against the pest. Negative correlations (P < 0.05) in mean annual egg numbers were found with departures from average of July temperature and January air or soil temperature; positive correlations (P < 0.05) with departure from average of August raindays. Stepwise regression analysis was used to identify the most important relationships of meteorological variables with mean annual egg numbers, or the proportion of fields sampled with egg numbers in excess of the action threshold of 2.5 million eggs/ha. Up to 59% of the variation in the annual proportion of fields above threshold was accounted for in a regression equation using departures from average of July temperature, August raindays and the percentage of average of October (preceding year) rainfall. Estimated mean annual egg populations and the proportion of fields above threshold showed a good fit with the observed values. The findings are discussed and compared with previous work.

To investigate adult emergence patterns in topographically heterogeneous habitats, we built a model of postdiapause development of the Bay checkerspot butterfly, Euphydryas editha bayensis. The model uses slope-specific insolation as the rate-controlling variable, and accounts for both solar exposure of the habitat and cloud cover. Instar-specific larval mass gains per unit of insolation were determined from mark-recapture experiments. A small correction for daily low temperatures was used to calibrate the model to five years of field data on larval mass. The model predicted mean mass of 90% of larval samples within 4 clear days over a 70-120 day growing season. The magnitude of spatial variation in emergence times across habitat slopes is greater than annual variation in emergence times due to yearly weather conditions. Historical variation (yearly shifts in larval distributions across slopes) is an important determinant of mean population emergence dates. All of these factors need to be considered in understanding adult emergence phenology in this butterfly and in other insects inhabiting heterogeneous thermal environments.

The interpolated, high-resolution (1 by 1 km pixels) minimum and maximum temperatures were input into a previously developed gypsy moth phenology model to predict egg hatch dates for a single season and for an average season as defined by climatological data. The single-season and climatological predictions were compared statistically to observed egg hatch dates at 15 sites in two states. The single-season predictions and the observed dates were only 2.1 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE) d apart when averaged over all sites, indicating that mesoscale data can successfully be used as input into gypsy moth phenology models. Although the results of the single-year simulation were mostly accurate, the mesoscale climatic predictions of egg hatch averaged 24.3 +/- 0.7 d after the observed date in the field. This difference was caused by the unusually warm spring in 1990 compared with a climatological (average) season.

Degree-days for larval development (threshold = 12.5-degrees-C) were 185 +/- 54 (SD) and were represented in the model by varying degree-day totals for six larval subpopulations. Oviposition of moths closely followed corn silking and was normally distributed for degree-days. Harvest-time distributions of larvae combined with ear damage tunnel lengths for each instar were used to estimate cullage and economic loss. The model was validated by comparing predictions with damage and economic loss in three randomly selected fields from each of 4 yr. The predicted versus actual damage distributions matched more closely than did larval distributions at harvest; predicted and actual economic losses differed by an average of $0.88/ha +/- $4.15 (SD), or 8.2% +/- 17.7%. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the change in economic loss caused by varying harvest date using one planting from 1990 that had earworm-induced losses of $22.16. Harvest 7 days early decreased loss to $18.79 (-19%). Harvest 7 days late increased loss to $25.39 (+10%), indicating that a delay in harvest has less effect on loss than an early harvest. Simulations were run to assess economic loss potential of an infestation level of 41% using 21 yr of temperature data and four silking dates.

In the three years of study, the second generation of the midge larvae were by 59-1 00 % more numerous than those of the first generation. In the cold year of 1987, the third generation larvae were the most numerous. Their numbers per three varieties were by 135-190 % higher than those of the second generation larvae. No correlation was found between the number of adults captured in yellow dishes and intensity of pod damage. Catches in yellow dishes indicate adult flight activity only. The use of the sum of effective temperatures, based on the lower threshold of development of the pest, in determining the time of occurrence of adult midges was inaccurate as the maximum occurrences of adults of the overwintered population differed in the years of study and they did not correlate with the temperature conditions in the respective years (Tab. I). A suitable method to study the occurrence of adults of the successive generations is used in cages containing infested pods, placed at the edges of fields (Fig. 1 ). No correlation was found between the number of mature larvae captured in dishes placed on the soil in winter rape stands and intensity of pod infestation. Comparing the cumulative mean numbers of larvae captured per dish in the three years of study, it appeared that the characteristics were not comparable. In 1987, with the highest percentage of destroyed pods (26.8 %), the number of larvae caught per dish (160-173) was half to that captured in 1986 in which 8.5 % of pods was damaged and an average of 308 larvae was captured per dish (Fig. 2). The brassica seed midge damages winter rape pods all along the fruit-body. In the three varieties under study, infested pods were found in tiers 1 to 14 from below. The percentage of infested pods in the head inflorescence, found in the three years of study, varied from 26 to 43.3 % depending on the variety.

This allows the insect model to simulate different population growth rates based on each compartment's average daily temperature.

The model predicted grain temperatures accurately for each of the nine compartments, except the center top portion of the grain mass. In this region, observed grain temperatures were 8-degrees-C higher than predicted during December. This may have been caused by convective air movement. In general, the model accurately predicted insect density for most of the bin compartments.

Individuals migrate into Britain each spring, and after one, two or three generations, offspring of the spring migrants return to over-wintering areas in North Africa and the Middle East. The larvae are highly polyphagous and have been recorded damaging many crops, especially Brassica spp. Insects usually migrate during the adults' pre-reproductive period (PRP). The length of this period is therefore an index of migratory potential since individuals with longer PRPs have more time to express their capacity for flight and to travel further. Individuals reared outside in Britain in autumn have longer PRPs than individuals reared outside in summer. Laboratory experiments show that PRPs are extended at low temperatures and under short photoperiods and there is some evidence that PRPs are also extended under gradually decreasing photoperiods.

Extensive PLH sampling across the Lower Peninsula of Michigan during 1989 indicated a major influx of this insect pest between 28 May and 3 June. Subsequent meteorological analysis showed ideal long-range transport conditions from the PLH source region into Michigan during this period, with the nocturnal jet in evidence around the 900 mbar level. Trajectory analysis at the 850, 900 and 950 mbar pressure levels indicated that the migration could have occurred in 24-36 h of continuous flight or in two to three successive night-only flights. Sufficiently warm flight temperatures and lack of major precipitation along all but the terminal portions of the trajectories were also in evidence. Heavy precipitation over the Lower Peninsula, cooler temperatures and/or depletion of energy supplies were probable causes for PLH flight termination. Potato leafhopper sampling was continued during the 1990 season. Based on the literature and the 1989 case study, the following simple criteria were used in conjunction with the latest synoptic forecast maps to manually predict possible dates for PLH arrival in Lower Michigan: (1) forecasted wind-flow (in the boundary layer or at 850 mbar) from the PLH overwintering region to Lower Michigan; (2) forecasted 850 mbar temperatures of 10-degrees-C or higher along the flight path.

Analysis of hourly soil temperature records, measured at egg pod depth in the field, showed that temperatures first dropped below this critical temperature threshold during mid-April, after which eggs became quiescent and overwintered until spring. There was no evidence of diapause in the field and overwintering eggs exhibited a wide range of embryonic development.

The range in the above phenological events averaged over years was greater for M. dirhodum than for S. avenae. The range of date of first catch was greater than the range of date by which 25 or 50% of the total catch was achieved, for both species. The ranges of date by which 75% of the total catch was achieved were markedly different in the north and south of Britain for both species. 7. The consistency of the flight phenologies between years varied independently for each species and was greater for S. avenae. However, for both species 1978 and 1981 were unusual, the date of first catch being earlier and the season extended later, especially at southern sites. 8.

Both low and high temperature stresses reduced plant growth and biomass, and influenced plant chemical composition. Insect food intake, growth, longevity, fecundity, and population increased significantly when IR2035 plants were grown at low and high (vs. optimum) temperature regimes (except 36/28-degrees-C). Insect performance on temperature-stressed TN1 plants was similar or superior to that on TN1 plants grown at optimum temperature, but at low temperatures, developmental period and longevity increased, while population decreased. At 36/28-degrees-C, the insect performed poorly on both resistant and susceptible plants. In spite of temperature-induced effects, the difference between resistance of IR2035 and susceptibility of TN1 remained distinct. Significantly more first instars died on TN1 plants painted with the steam-distillate extract of resistant IR2035 plants (grown at all temperatures studied) than on acetone-treated TN1 plants.

The objective of this 2-yr field study was to measure plant response and yield under ridge tillage or spring disk tillage in fields artificially infested with western corn rootworm (D. virgifera virgifera LeConte). Corn rootworm infestations were applied at 0, 1650, 3300, or 6600 viable eggs m-1. We measured insect survival to adult, root damage rating, nodal root volume (Nodes 4 and above) at maximum insect damage, and grain yield. In 1988, which was characterized by above-normal temperature and below-normal precipitation, root damage increased (6.7 rating at 1650 eggs m-1 to 7.9 at 6600 eggs m-1) and insect survival to adult decreased (4.9% at 1650 eggs m-1 to 1.2% at 6600 eggs m-1) with increasing infestation level under both tillage systems. During the 1988 season, plants grown under ridge tillage had larger nodal root systems (17.9 mL) than under spring disk tillage (9.9 mL). Ridge-tilled plants also had greater yield (5.5 vs. 4.1 Mg ha-1 with no rootworm eggs; 4.3 vs. 3.1 with 1650 eggs m-1; and 4.1 vs. 2.2 Mg ha-1 with 3300 eggs m-1). In 1989, which had near normal temperature but below-normal precipitation during the growing season, root damage increased (from a 1.1 to 5.9 rating as the infestation level increased from 0 to 6600 eggs m-1) and insect survival to adult decreased (from 1.3 to 0.7% as the infestation level increased from 1650 to 6600 eggs m-1) under both tillage systems. Tillage practice had no effect on plant response to rootworm feeding or yield. However, the number of nodal root axes per plant (22.4) and grain yield (8.8 Mg ha-1) were increased significantly under both tillage systems infested with 6600 eggs m-1 of row (29.0 axes per plant and 10.2 Mg ha-1).

In this study, development times of eggs and instars of L. sativae were determined at constant temperatures of 20, 25, 30, and 35 +/- 1-degrees-C on Phaseolus lunatus L. 'Henderson'. Development rates of eggs and larvae increased linearly with temperature up to 35-degrees-C (r2 greater-than-or-equal-to 0.95). More than 91% of the variation in development rate of first and second instars was explained by temperature, whereas temperature explained only 42% of the variation in third-instar development rate. A part of the variation in development rate of third instars may be explained by the fact that the designated end point of this stadium (emergence of third instars from leaves) occurred only during the photophase. Overall, 99.9% of larvae emerged from leaves after 95 degree-days (DD) (threshold temperature, 10-degrees-C). When the constant temperature data were used to parameterize a stochastic phenology model for L. sativae, the model predicted that 50% of the population would advance beyond the egg and first-, second-, and third-instar stages by 39.2, 67.0, 85.5, and 101.2 DD, respectively. The model predicted peak proportions of the population to be in first, second, and third stadia at 52.7, 76.1, and 93.2 DD. Pooled data from two fluctuating temperature experiments resulted in very similar estimates of timing of peak stage proportions (51.3, 74.4, and 94.1 DD, respectively).

An increase of 3-degrees-C in mean daily temperature would cause the cabbage root fly to become active about a month earlier in the year than at present. Under such conditions, the emergence of flies from the overwintering population would be less synchronised, as the completion of diapause and post-diapause development would occur at the same time in different individuals within the population. However, there would continue to be only three generations of fly each year, even in the south of England.

C maculaalba has a single generation a year. It is only able to place its eggs in 1 to 2-day old capsules. The excitation mechanism of egg laying is: 1. in response to the fragrance of flowers as an olfactostimulus the female adults gather in the poppy flowers; 2. the specific stimulatns of the capsule, as contact chemostimuli induce mastication of the adults, then with the third stimulus - the roundness of the capsule as a form stimulus - added to the former two the female adult is moved to pierce the capsule with its proboscis and place its eggs through the hole thus made in the capsule. The antennae also play a decisive role in egg laying. Even such adults as possessing mere scapes are able to lay eggs, while those without scape do not lay eggs.

J,"Howe, RW","THE BIOLOGY OF THE TWO COMMON STORAGE SPECIES OF ORYZAEPHILUS (COLEOPTERA, CUCUJIDAE)","Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) and 0. mercator (Fauv.) are distinct species which do not interbreed; they can be distinguished by the relative lengths of eye and temple and by the male genitalia. Both species are imported into Britain, 0. surinamensis chiefly on cereal products and 0. mercator chiefly on oilseed products. 0. mercator is killed by cold in Britain, but 0. surinamensis can survive and not infrequently becomes a pest. Eggs hatched at temperatures from 17.5 to 40' C. Egg mortality was high below zoo C. and above 3 7 ' 5 O C. Low humidity also increased egg mortality but did not affect the length of the instar which was shortest at 35O C. and above. On wheatfeed, the larva of 0. mercator grew more slowly than that of 0. surinamensis and was more sensitive tolow humidities. The optimumfor 0. mercatorwas about 30-32. C. and that for 0. surinamensis about 3-35' C. Low humidity increased the length of the larval period, and at 10 % R. H., 0. mercator died outside the range 25-32* 5 C. The shortest pupal period was observed at over 35' C. On coconut meal at 30 C. and 70 yo R. H., 0. mercator grew faster than 0. surinarnensis, which could not grow on this food at lower humidities. 0. mercator grew more slowly on this food than on wheatfeed. Neither species completed development on groundnut meal unless yeast powder was added. The usual number of larval moults before pupation was three, but a few individuals had four or two. The longer larval period of 0. mercator is explained partly by the individual instars being slightly longer than in 0. surinamensis and partly by the increased tendency for the latter species to have only two larval moults. The preoviposition period of both species at 30 and 33O C. was 3-8 days, usually about 5. 0. mercator reached a peak of three eggs per female per day and 0. surinamensis of 6-10 per female per day by the end of a week and maintained these rates for a month, laying about 200 and 375 eggs per female respectively. About 95 % of eggs hatched. Both species can increase rapidly in the tropics, but neither can grow very quickly in unheated stores in Britain. 0. surinamensis is a pest because it can survive in large numbers in the fabric of warehouses and multiply rapidly when warm or actively heating produce becomes available.",no,,,,,ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,0003-4746,1744-7348,1956,10.1111/j.1744-7348.1956.tb02127.x,WOS:000208966500011
